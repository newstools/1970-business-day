Ratings agency Moody s announced on Monday that it would be retaining its negative outlook on the South African banking system.Moody s said it expected the sector to remain under pressure for the next 12-18 months, due mainly to "weak operating conditions".It said as a result of the "volatile and unpredictable" political climate in SA, reduced business and consumer confidence would lead to sluggish economic growth.The ratings agency now forecasts SA s economy to grow just 0.5% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018. It pointed out this was well below the government s National Development Plan s growth target of 5.4%.Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said in a speech earlier on Monday that it was likely the Treasury s current forecast of 1.3% growth this year was optimistic, and may well be revised lower when he delivered his medium-term budget policy statement in late October.SA s unemployment rate remained unchanged at 27.7% in the June quarter from the March quarter, dashing hopes of a slight improvement. The numbers paint a gloomy picture of the country s prospects over the near term, with the expanded unemployment rate at 36.4%. This figure includes discouraged job seekers and has remained stubbornly high for several years now.Youth unemployment, which encompasses those aged 15-24 years, now stands at 32.2%. This number excludes those in some sort of training or education.Moody s did say, however, that although credit quality would deteriorate, "capital will remain resilient"."As the ultimate line of defence against asset-quality deterioration, South African banks report solid capital metrics, well above regulatory minima and our central scenario is that capital buffers will [be] protected by profits," it said.Moody s rated seven South African banks, accounting for about 91% of banking sector assets, as at December 2016.

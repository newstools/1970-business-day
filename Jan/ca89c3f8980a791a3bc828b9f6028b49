Kumba Iron Ore reported increased first-quarter sales as production increased at both its mines in the Northern Cape.Kumba, SA s largest iron ore miner, is 70% held by Anglo American, which has said it wants to sell its stake in the company as it streamlined its portfolio of mines to focus on platinum, diamonds and copper and selected bulk commodities like metallurgical coal.Anglo is wary of the iron ore market and CEO Mark Cutifani has said Kumba is not big enough to influence prices like the big three of Vale, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. Iron ore prices have fallen steeply in the past month as demand from China slowed.Kumba s total March quarter output from its Sishen and Kolomela mines increased by 17% to 10.47-million tonnes compared with the sale period a year earlier, but was 12% lower when compared with the final quarter of 2016.The full-year guidance remained unchanged at between 40-million and 42-million tonnes.Total sales for the first quarter were up 3% to 10.89-million tonnes year on year, but 3% lower quarter on quarter.The 7% increase in export sales of 10.05-million tonnes was offset by a 29% reduction in domestic sales to 833,000 tonnes compared with the first quarter of 2016, which included 717,000 tonnes of ore sold from the now-closed Thabazimbi mine.Compared with the December quarter, export sales were 5% lower, while domestic sales increased by 36%.Sishen, the flagship mine, increased March quarter output by 31% to 7.7-million tonnes year on year. However, compared with the December quarter when the mine was accessing ore with less waste, production was 10% lower.Both mines were affected by higher than expected rainfall, with waste stripping at Sishen matching the 34-million tonnes extracted in the first quarter of 2016. Kumba management said mining rates improved late in the quarter, setting the mine up to reach its target of between 150-million and 160-million tonnes.Kolomela s output of 2.8-million tonnes was 3% higher than a year ago, but 19% lower than in the December quarter, mainly because of the rain.Waste mining jumped 32% to 10-million tonnes as the mine was set up to increase output. Full-year waste mining was set at between 50-million and 55-million tonnes.Kumba had 3.2-million tonnes of stockpiled ore, compared with 3.5-million tonnes at the end of December.

The South African bond market was slightly weaker late on Tuesday, as the rand slipped towards the R13.20 to the dollar mark.But even so, the market lacked a clear trend as the crucial US Federal Reserve&rsquo;s two-day meeting to decide on interest rates got under way.Markets expect the US central bank to increase rates on Wednesday.Higher US rates usually make the dollar appealing as they boost returns on assets denominated in the currency."It&rsquo;s always a little concerning when markets are so certain that an event is going to happen and we&rsquo;ve seen plenty of examples of this backfiring in 2016 alone," Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said.The yield on the benchmark R186 bond was at 8.685% in late trade, from 8.655% and the R206 was at 7.700% from 7.665%.The US 10-year treasury bond was bid at 2.5995% from 2.6251% previously.

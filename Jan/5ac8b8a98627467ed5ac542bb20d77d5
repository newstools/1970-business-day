South Africans are playing real-estate checkers as property confidence in some of the country&#8217;s upmarket suburbs fluctuates.They&#8217;re migrating to provinces that offer better career prospects&#8218; quality of life&#8218; ease of travel and secure estate living.Those with money to invest are not only casting their eyes to the popular Western Cape but also snapping up top-end properties on KwaZulu-Natal&#8217;s north coast&#8218; according to a well-known property group.Property research company Lightstone Property recently unpacked which provinces South African homeowners are migrating to. It analysed the buyer behaviour of repeat homeowners over a five-year period.&quot;A quick glance at the data confirms the finds of Statistics SA with more than 15% of home-owners once residing in Limpopo&#8218; Mpumalanga and North West moving to Gauteng. This could be indicative of people who are looking for better job opportunities and career growth in a bigger metro such as Gauteng&#8218;&quot; Lightstone Property found.Lightstone found that the largest migration was towards Gauteng and Western Cape.But a Business Times report this weekend showed that political uncertainty had affected the high-end house market in Johannesburg: in particular&#8218; the upmarket area of Westcliff has been hit by the downturn.It reported that fewer homes in the sought-after neighbourhood had sold in recent years&#8218; with only one property valued at more than R20m sold in 2017.According to Business Times&#8218; 12 properties were sold in the suburb in 2016 compared to 18 in 2015 and 24 in 2014.Property experts believe that crime&#8218; corruption and poor service delivery have forced property owners to look at more investor-friendly regions like Cape Town.&quot;The Western Cape is a popular destination for those looking to purchase holiday homes or enjoy a more laid-back way of life&#8218; which could be a big driver of migration to the province.&quot;The analysis also showed the City of Tshwane is the most popular municipality to relocate to&#8218; &quot;while Pretoria seems to be the most popular town&quot;.&quot;Regardless of reasoning for moving from one place to another&#8218; the fact that relocation within SA looks to be happening on a regular basis &#8212; contributing in large part to property supply and demand across provinces &#8212; is good news for the property market on the whole&#8218;&quot; said Lightstone Property.When it comes to high-end property&#8218; Pam Golding Properties has noted a shift from the Western Cape to KwaZulu-Natal for Johannesburg residents with cash to splash.Neil De Beer&#8218; area manager for Ballito on the north coast said 60% to 70% of buyers in the upmarket Zimbali were from Gauteng&#8218; &quot;semigrating to the coast&quot;.Secure estate living&#8218; easy access to the King Shaka International airport for commuters and the close proximity to the beach&#8218; are the main drawcards for upcountry buyers&#8218; say the experts.Sandra Gordon&#8218; senior research analyst for Pam Golding Properties&#8218; said: &quot;While the ongoing semigration of South Africans from the interior to the coastal provinces has been a critical factor behind the out-performance of the Western Cape housing market in recent years&#8218; it appears that soaring Cape house prices&#8218; combined with worsening congestion in the Mother City&#8218; is prompting many home buyers to consider other coastal destinations &#8211; particularly the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal.&quot;

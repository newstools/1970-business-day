In August 1971, Private Eye magazine did something that made north London liberals extremely cross. It published a cartoon featuring two tribesmen, dressed in grass skirts and colourful headgear, standing on a termite mound addressing their subjects."I will now ask the chancellor of the exchequer," the taller of the two declares, "to present his budget speech."Nearly 47 years later about the time it has taken for this jumpy lot to calm down the cartoon has gone and come to life in SA. An actual Village Elder of Number Count and Forecast-ing Accurate Make has been created; his name is Prof Christopher Malikane.Malikane was the subject of criticism even before he addressed an audience last Saturday night at the Blacks in Dialogue seminar. Calls have been made for his dismissal as an adviser to Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba some have even gone so far as to demand his silencing.However primitive, prejudiced or discredited Malikane s views are, the calls for his sacking or muzzling are deeply unfair and expose opposition parties failure to understand the complexities of freedoms of speech.There is also a clear failure of context and absurdity herein: the audience was assembled by the crooked movement Black First Land First, where the scallywag leader belted out "one settler one bullet" even as the same master of ceremonies informed guests that the lights of a Porsche in the car park had been left on. Malikane must have found himself in an awkward position: unless he attached something slightly lively to his Lenin/Khmer Rouge/Great-Leap-Forward thesis nonsense, he would have bored that smartly dressed Gupta militia intoa coma.Malikane is not the first academic to hold these views. Economics professors in western universities (particularly in the UK at the University of Sussex, Thabo Mbeki s alma mater) have long bemoaned capitalism as responsible for inequality and sought to emphasise this in the minds of their students as a means to change the system from within.&nbsp;The problem is that when these kids emerge and have to repay student loans or have a child or attempt to integrate into the upward mobility of the newly employed generation with all its features, the hype of their dour professors becomes a set of distant, romantic and forgettable delusions.The surprise at Malikane s appointment is itself puzzling because November was only a few months ago. It was then that Gigaba (as home affairs minister) stood up in Parliament to defend President Jacob Zuma against a vote of no confidence.He delivered a speech that would have impressed a very small section of the world, probably only the uncontacted tribe inhabiting North Sentinel Island (around whom there is a three nautical mile exclusion zone), because he didn t defend Zuma at all but rather quoted from the anarchist s handbook, portraying blacks, once again, as helpless, incapable victims of orchestrated conspiracy.But he ll soon feel, if he isn t already, the weight of reality against these populist fantasies. This, I imagine, will occur during an investor roadshow; in a moment that resembles how the Chinese delegation responded to Nelson Mandela s fawning over "communists" in Davos in 1994, Gigaba will have to hear how it was Fidel Castro s advice, taken literally by Hugo Chavez, that is responsible for Venezuela s mess.And that Robert Mugabe, the object of his love poetry during his reign as leader of the ANC Youth League, was never interested in mass economic liberation but had to stay on in 1999 because all the money he had stolen and stashed away in Ghana was confiscated by his late wife s family there. He went slightly mad.Gigaba will also have to find a way to express to an increasingly confused citizenry that "radical economic transformation" means only an amendment to existing procurement policies, mostly by state-owned enterprises, because there is nothing more that can be done within constitutional parameters.The way opposition parties and commentators have it in for Malikane is worrying, particularly when you analyse the calls in the light of the pending hate speech bill, which is the most appalling piece of literature to have appeared in Parliament to date.Malikane must be free to express his views, without fear of threat, and the South African public particularly opposition parties must appreciate that the appointment of a hamlet economist is yet another splendid opportunity to expose the narrow, provincial qualities of officials who have surfaced in mind-boggling numbers during Zuma s administration.

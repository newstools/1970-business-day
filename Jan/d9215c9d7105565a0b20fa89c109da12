The Treasury says it is not participating in the negotiations with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) for the contract for payment of grants.This comes after the Department of Social Development stated that it had asked for the Treasury&rsquo;s participation. However&sbquo; the Treasury said the request could not be favourably considered.This was because the procurement regulatory framework delegated that responsibility to the accounting officer of the respective department, and because the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and the Department of Social Services had announced publicly that at some point, they would approach the Treasury to regularise process under way.In the light of this&sbquo; "the participation of National Treasury at this stage will amount to a conflict of interest"."National Treasury remains committed to assist when required to find solutions within the confines of the constitution and the procurement regulatory framework, to ensure that the deserving beneficiaries of the grants did not suffer."TMG Digital

London Gold dipped on Thursday as the dollar strengthened, but losses were capped by continuing economic uncertainty around Britain s departure from the European Union (EU) and approaching French elections.The potential for the rise of the far right in European elections this year, along with British Prime Minister Theresa May formally triggering divorce proceedings from the EU on Wednesday has served to enhance gold s appeal as a safe-haven investment, negating some of the effects of a strong dollar."We might see support from the French elections if the first round surprises us by the results being better than expected for (far right leader) Marine Le Pen. That might give a little bit of a boost for gold," said Bernard Dahdah, a precious metals analyst at Natixis. Spot gold was down 0.25% at $1,248.27 an ounce by 2.13pm GMT and US gold futures slipped by 0.5% to $1,248."The market seemed to take the notification of the (triggering of) Article 50 in the UK relatively smoothly, but I suspect the worst is yet to come on that," said ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes."But certainly, there was a tiny bit of safe-haven buying." The dollar edged up to a nine-day high against a basket of currencies on Thursday. A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially lowering demand. The dollar was also boosted by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who said he was in line with most of his colleagues in supporting further interest rate increases this year."The market has priced in two interest rate increases this year, but if we see three there could be downside pressure towards gold prices," said ETF Securities analyst Nitesh Shah.In other precious metals, spot silver slipped 0.2% to $18.15 an ounce, having hit a four-week high of $18.25 in the previous session.Platinum rose 0.2% to $950.50, while palladium was up 0.9% to $797.50.Reuters

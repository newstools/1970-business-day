It said his &quot;visionary leadership&#8218; passion and determination have seen the airline become the second-largest regional airline in the Middle East Africa region (according to an independent survey by Airline Business)&quot;.&quot;SA Express&#8217;s route network currently covers five SADC [Southern African Development Community] countries and 17 major local and regional routes&#8218;&quot; spokesperson Refiloe Masemola said.&quot;After 13 years of faithful service&#8218; Inati Ntshanga will be greatly missed but his successes and vision will continue to be a driver for the continued sustainability and improved performance of the airline&#8218;&quot; she said.Ntshanga was appointed general manager: strategy and market development in 2014.The company said that until a replacement was found it would be under executive management and the board.&quot;We would like to assure our passengers that through this transitional period&#8218; SA Express continues to function as a well-oiled machine.&quot;The SA Express board of directors will make an announcement regarding his replacement in a few days&#8217; time.&quot;The regional airline has been under considerable pressure&#8218; including last May when the Civil Aviation Authority grounded it after it failed to meet safety standards.The grounding&#8218; which lasted a weekend&#8218; had been due to the company&#8217;s equipment failing to pick up problems in the system.The aviation authority&#8217;s executive for aviation safety&#8218; Simon Segwabe&#8218; said at the time: &quot;Every time an aircraft is prepared for a flight the airline must give a guarantee that it is airworthy. We could not trust that&#8218; and that is why we have suspended their flights.&quot;Last month Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown was forced to save her &quot;problem child&quot; after it failed to repay R150m in loans to Nedbank and Rand Merchant Bank. Briefing Parliament&#8217;s public enterprises portfolio committee&#8218; she said the airline faced profitability and liquidity issues and was unable to pay its debts.The airline was expected to pay R150m to its lenders by February 24&#8218; &quot;failing which its government guarantee would be triggered&#8218; requiring payment within 30 business days&quot;.Brown said SA Express was able to make payment of only R58m. Her department had negotiated payment instalments with Nedbank and Rand Merchant Bank for the remainder.With four aircraft grounded&#8218; the company is also in urgent need of a new fleet but Brown said a Public Finance Management Act application for funding had been declined.The company is included in government plans to rationalise airline operations &#8212; which include SAA and a 2.5% share in Airlink &#8212; in a bid to cut costs.The company failed to table its annual financial statements to Parliament after it could not satisfy the auditor general&#8217;s solvency and liquidity tests.SA Express has a R1.1bn state guarantee to keep it aloft.

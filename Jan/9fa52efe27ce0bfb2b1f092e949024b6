SA&#8217;s bulk export volumes plunged by 27.4% year on year in April to 12.3-million tonnes after soaring 27.4% in March to 14.1-million tonnes, says Transnet National Ports Authority.These massive swings are, in part, due to an enhanced &quot;Easter effect&quot; as the holidays fell in March in 2016 but in April in 2017. This boosted the year-on-year comparison for March and reduced it for April.In March, bulk exports out of Saldanha &#8212; mostly iron ore &#8212; almost doubled (up 95.3%) to 5.8-million tonnes, though this was followed by a 34.75% drop to 4.2-million tonnes in April.Bulk exports out of Richards Bay &#8212; mostly coal &#8212; rose only 1.1% year on year in March to 7.3-million tonnes, but fell by 22.2% in April to 6.7-million tonnes.The exception to the April slump was bulk exports from other ports, which ship agricultural goods, such as grain and sugar. These rose 17.3% in April to 1.3-million tonnes.In the first quarter of 2017, bulk export volumes grew 11.7% year on year, but the plunge in April reduced the year-to-date increase to only 0.9% year on year. The record annual increase in this century was 9% set in 2010.&#169; Business Day

South Africans have to unite around a common platform of protecting the country s constitutional democracy, which is under "dire threat", the SACP s Jeremy Cronin says.Cronin, the SACP s deputy secretary-general, addressed the Cape Town Press Club on Wednesday on how SA had reached the current conjuncture, in which the state is in the grip of state capture.He warned that South Africans needed to recognise the danger the country was in.The minimum demands that should unite opponents to state capture should include an independent judicial commission of inquiry into state capture, with a clear and circumscribed mandate.Criminal charges should be laid where there was strong and prima facie evidence of criminal activity. This should include serving Cabinet ministers who seemed to be "deeply implicated" in the allegations of state capture.Cronin said the governance of state-owned enterprises had to be sorted out as they had become the "soft underbelly" for the looting of public resources.Another pillar of the common platform should be that the government immediately cut ties with the Guptas, even if only for narrow electoral reasons.Cronin believed the ANC was "dreaming" if it thought it could win 50% of the vote in the next general election if it continued on the current trajectory involving the Guptas.He emphasised that President Jacob Zuma needed to step down as no progress could be made if he remained in office. State capture which existed before the Zuma administration had gone into "steroid mode" since Zuma took over.Finally, poverty, inequality and unemployment had to be addressed, as the constitutional democracy was unsustainable with 9-million people unemployed.This created the space in which demagoguery and populism thrived.Cronin highlighted the growing authoritarianism that was emerging.

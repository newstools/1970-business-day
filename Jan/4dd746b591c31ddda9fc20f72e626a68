Six single-religion schools were singled out on Tuesday for having unconstitutional religious practices that did not accommodate the variety of religions that the South African Schools Act protects, other than Christianity.The Act upholds the constitutional right to religion, thought and belief free from unfair discrimination whatsoever and the strict teaching of one religion has been prohibited, outside of private schools, in the country.In what could be a precedent-setting case, the Organisasie vir Godsdienste-Onderrig en Demokrasie (Ogod) represented by Section 27 sought an order from the Gauteng High Court declaring the six public schools in Gauteng and the Western Cape to be in violation of the constitution and the National Policy on Religion and Education.The policy, which is applicable to all schools, has a curricular programme on religion education that aims to teach students about religious diversity.The applicants contended before Judge Colin Lamont that because Christian practices were conducted as part of the formal religious observances at each of the respondent schools, they did not take into consideration the effects of the religious isolation on children who were not Christian.The applicants argued that at all six respondent schools, there were religious observances in the form of scripture reading and prayer at formal school functions such as annual prize givings, while all of them allowed Christian associations to make use of the schools facilities. The primary schools also included religious instruction in classrooms.On the other hand, the respondents legal team s Werner Human said the applicants had singled out these White, Afrikaaner schools but there were thousands of others practising Christian ethos across the country. We want to protect the right of schools to express themselves and their religious character, Human said it s important to note that this is not exclusively a Christian character referred to. He added that schools and the Constitution are designed to reflect all in a society, which is ensured by the profile of the school governing body (SGB) reflecting the broader community.The Gauteng Schools Education Act states that religious policy, which accommodates all religions, should be made by the SGB after consulting the department.Attorney for the National Association of School Governing Bodies Elizabeth Parker said it is not realistic to have a one-size fits all solution for schools and it has to be undertaken in terms of the individual SGBs. She said what is happening in practice is that SGBs, which comprise community members and parents, decide on how to apply the religion and education policy: How it is in practice at the moment accommodates all different kinds of religions.

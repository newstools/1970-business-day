Embattled Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini was on Monday yet to confirm whether she would appear before Parliament&rsquo;s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) on Tuesday.Scopa chairman Themba Godi said: "We wrote to her last week Tuesday for her to appear in front of the committee. So we are expecting her ... the norm is that when officials and ministers are invited&sbquo; they do confirm."But up until now I have not received any confirmation&sbquo;" he told TMG Digital on Monday.Godi said the committee hoped to "discuss the issues at hand" if she attended the meeting on Tuesday&sbquo; after failing to do so last week.He also said the committee would have to consider other options &ndash; including issuing a subpoena &mdash; should Dlamini not attend the meeting."The power to subpoena is there for all the committees of Parliament&sbquo; but in terms of what we will do&sbquo; that will be a decision that the committee will decide tomorrow&sbquo;" he said.Dlamini and her department have been embroiled in controversy over the possibility of 17-million social grant recipients not being paid on April 1.Following a Constitutional Court order which declared the contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) invalid&sbquo; the department failed to do anything about it&sbquo; leaving the poorest of the poor vulnerable.Godi said he believed the looming crisis was a "manufactured emergency". The department knew the contract would come to an end."Right from the beginning it was not an endless contract even before we went to the Constitutional Court and I m sure in that whole office someone has a calendar so our point is that it is not an emergency that came out of the blue."People knew what was happening, and I think the resignation of [Zane] Dangor as the director-general merely confirms that " he said."I know many executives and staff in the department want to do the right thing but don t have the necessary political support to do it."On Sunday night former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor claimed on Facebook that a Gupta-linked company would "be appointed at the 11th hour to distribute grants".Godi said he was aware of the claim but did not want to comment on it."Well there are lots of comments flying around in all directions, and we will not want to be diverted by those things. We will remain focused. Our main concern is the fiscus and how it is used. We want accountability in that " he said.TMG Digital

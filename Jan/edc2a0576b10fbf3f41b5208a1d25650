It fell to an intraday weakest R13.0558, before recovering after analysts said it was highly unlikely the Constitution would be amended to accommodate Mkhwebane s recommendation.The requirements for a constitutional change that would shift the Reserve Bank s mandate from protecting the value of the rand in favour of the socioeconomic wellbeing of citizens was unlikely, Nomura s emerging-markets investment economist Peter Attard Montalto said.Bonds weakened in line with the rand with the benchmark R186 was last bid at 8.53% from 8.47%.Futures tracked the stronger JSE.

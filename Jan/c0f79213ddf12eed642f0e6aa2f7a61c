The JSE was firmer on Tuesday at midday as mining and resource stocks rallied on a weaker rand, as the market digested S&amp;P Global Ratings announcement that it had downgraded SA s credit rating to subinvestment grade.Moody s was also expected to downgrade SA s credit rating following its statement on Monday that it was placing the country s Baa2 rating on review.Rand Merchant Bank analyst John Cairns said the loss of investment grade had come as a further psychological blow to a country that was obsessed for years with being downgraded, and that it would entrench a higher cost of offshore borrowing.S&amp;P s long-term local currency rating is now on the edge of subinvestment grade, still with a negative outlook. Cairns said one more downgrade from S&amp;P and SA would start to lose investment in the local bond market the main source of financial inflows in the past few years.The Dow closed flat (-0.06%) on Monday and the Nikkei 225 was down 0.91% in early morning trade.At midday, the all share was up 0.71% at 52 828.5 points and the blue-chip top 40 added 0.89%.

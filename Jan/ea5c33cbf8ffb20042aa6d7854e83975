The JSE closed weaker on Wednesday as ratings downgrade-sensitive stocks, such as banks, retailers and property, came under pressure ahead of expected further ratings announcements later in the week.At R27bn, volumes were much higher compared with earlier in the week.Resources stocks were also weaker in line with softer commodity prices, as Brent crude tumbled on the day. A late recovery in the platinum price brought some relief to platinum stocks, but further gains were capped by the stable rand.The platinum price was up 0.75% to $945.45 an ounce in evening trade with the rand at R13.1872 to the dollar from R13.1546$.Rand hedges were up on the day, though Naspers ended the day sharply lower.The market has largely priced in a one-notch downgrade from Moody s in the local and foreign currency ratings from Baa2 to Baa3.The big question is whether Moody s will downgrade SA by two notches, and keep the outlook negative. The expectation is that Moody s will change the outlook to stable. A two-notch downgrade by Moody s is unlikely, but analysts say markets could be affected adversely if a negative outlook is assigned.Futuregrowth portfolio manager Wikus Furstenberg said the market was bracing itself for Moody s as well as the S&amp;P Global Ratings scheduled rating update on SA on Friday. "We expect S&amp;P to leave our ratings unchanged for now, but to retain the negative outlook," he said.Furstenberg said this by no means implies that SA is out of the woods: "We still expect more downgrades down the line."Analysts said there was also some profit-taking in the market following a good run since the beginning of May.Brent crude shed more than 3% in late afternoon trade to $50.52 a barrel as the market reacted negatively to oil cartel Opec s failure to extend production cuts further.Local stocks were also hit by disappointing trade data for April, released on the day.

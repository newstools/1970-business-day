The FTSE 100 lost 0.42%, the CAC 40 0.59% and the DAX 0.61%.Minutes released by the European Central Bank on Thursday showed that the bank was worried about how best to communicate increasing confidence in the eurozone economy without roiling markets, Dow Jones Newswires said.Most analysts interpreted the minutes from the past US Federal Reserve meeting released on Wednesday as hawkish, though this did little to support the greenback. The lack of inflationary pressures, however, appeared to be taking their toll on the appetite for more rate increases among some policy makers, said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam.The platinum price was down 0.48% to $905.78 an ounce and gold 0.26% to $1,223.82 an ounce.Brent crude was 1.44% higher at $48.911 a barrel.

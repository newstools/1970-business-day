London &#8212; Oil prices rose on Friday, recouping some of the previous session&#8217;s losses, as a weaker dollar encouraged buying but investors remained cautious after Russian production figures showed weak compliance with a global deal to cut output.Global benchmark Brent was up 36 cents at $55.44 a barrel at 2.56pm GMT, recovering some of Thursday&#8217;s losses that amounted to more than 2%. WTI futures traded at $52.97 a barrel, up 36 cents on the previous close.&quot;The market is range bound, therefore there is nothing surprising in seeing fresh buying after a big sell-off and of course the slightly weaker dollar is also helping oil recover,&quot; said Tamas Varga, senior analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.The dollar slipped from a seven-week high on Friday ahead of a key speech by Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen.A weaker greenback makes it more attractive to buy dollar-denominated currencies like oil futures.&quot;Because prices have failed once again to rise above their trading corridors, there is a growing risk of speculative selling,&quot; said analysts at Commerzbank, suggesting further downside potential.Oil&#8217;s gains were capped after concerns remained over non-Opec compliance with a global deal to rein in oversupply.Russia&#8217;s February oil output was unchanged from January at 11.11-million barrels per day (bpd), energy ministry data showed, with its cuts from October 2016 levels remaining at 100,000 bpd or a third of what was pledged by Moscow under its agreement with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Official US data also showed crude inventories in the world&#8217;s biggest oil consumer rose for an eighth straight week to a record 520.2-million barrels last week.But even as US oil production rose and Russian output held steady, Opec boosted already strong compliance with the group&#8217;s six-month deal to 94%, cutting output for a second month in February, a Reuters survey found.In a bid to maintain demand for its oil, world top exporter Saudi Arabia has cut the price for its April light crude deliveries to Asia, trade sources told Reuters.Reuters

South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has mooted a long-term plan for social grants administration that may entail it operating as a bank.The proposal is for an integrated social grant administration and payment process with Sassa as a participant in the national payment system and having a special exemption under banking laws to play this role.Beneficiaries would be issued with Sassa payment cards backed up by biometric verification. The agency envisages phasing in this plan in 2019.In a presentation last week to Parliament&rsquo;s social development committee, Tim Masela, head of the Reserve Bank&rsquo;s national payment system department, said the Reserve Bank supported the principles of interoperability and mitigation of risk through an open architecture approach. It supported a system in which beneficiaries would select their own bank accounts to receive payments.These accounts could have features defined by Sassa. The SA Post Office should be brought in for cash payments in remote areas.The other option was for Sassa to take over the overall payment process and entail Sassa operating as a bank and hosting beneficiary accounts.But the drawbacks of this option were that it would duplicate existing infrastructure, diminish the efficiencies derived from economies of scale and introduce concentration risk."Sassa should ideally not host accounts of their own. The South African Reserve Bank does not support arrangements where nonbanks duplicate existing infrastructures as these work against the efficiency objectives of the national payments system," he told MPs.

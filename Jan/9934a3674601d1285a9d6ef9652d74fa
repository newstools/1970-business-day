KwaZulu-Natal public sector doctors and other medical specialists will embark on protest marches and other industrial action in the next two weeks to force the province s department of health to improve their working conditions and infrastructure at their places of work.The South African Medical Association s (Sama s) coastal KwaZulu-Natal branch has resolved to embark on a protest march in Durban to highlight the collapse of the healthcare system in the province.On Thursday Dr Mvuyisi Mzukwa, chairman of Sama s KwaZulu-Natal coastal branch, said the body was calling on all doctors, specialists and other medical staff in the public sector to support the industrial action aimed at creating public awareness of the poor state of public healthcare in the province and to force the government to employ more qualified staff, buy adequate equipment and build sound infrastructure.The doctors expressed frustration at the department s decision to unilaterally change the conditions of employment of all doctors, freezing critical posts and introducing a new commuted overtime policy without adequate consultation.Sama complained about a total collapse in the departments of oncology, urology and in the ear, nose and throat section.Dr Mzukwa said the department had failed to replace critical equipment. Buildings were crumbling to such an extent that one had to use umbrellas in certain wards. Our members are reporting a variety of problems on a daily basis including burnout, mass resignations, and the relocation of doctors to other provinces. This situation is getting worse every day and, as healthcare professionals, we are duty-bound to do something about it. This situation cannot continue without meaningful intervention, said Dr Mzukwa.The KwaZulu-Natal health department said on Thursday it noted the concerns of Sama but felt some of the complaints were exaggerated. Health MEC Dr Sbongiseni Dhlomo said the department was doing its best within budget constraints to invest in the infrastructure of public health institutions.Many doctors and specialists were leaving for the private sector because they get more lucrative opportunities there, he said. The private sector had more than 50 oncologists in eThekwini alone while the public sector had just two there and four in Umgungundlovu district.

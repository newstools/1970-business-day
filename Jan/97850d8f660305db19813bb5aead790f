The South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) on Tuesday described as misleading reports that the public was not sufficiently informed of a pending rise in toll fees.However, the agency said it would explore using additional social media platforms to inform motorists.This comes after a warning from the Automobile Association (AA) that Sanral risked alienating the public over the March 3 toll fee increases, as not all members were aware of them.The AA said its concerns were also based on possible reactions from motorists from April 1 2017, when additional taxes on fuel came into effect.In February, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan announced in the national budget that the Road Accident Fund levy and the fuel levy would rise a combined 39c/l, a move that the AA said would probably entail a 35% tax per litre with effect from April.Toll tariffs on national roads were adjusted in February in line with the consumer price index, with an average increase of 6% across SA, and gazetted in February.Sanral spokesman Vusi Mona said on Tuesday that the publication of the tariffs in the government gazette had allowed for comment from the public and organised bodies."It is one thing to say there was no communication, but quite another to call for the use of more communication platforms, something we will explore in the future," Mona said.Sanral said it remained committed to reducing the burden of tolls &mdash; particularly on lower- and middle-income road users.The agency said the AA had failed to note that caps on tolls fees, discounts and reduced tolls during nonpeak hours were in place for e-tolling in Gauteng.

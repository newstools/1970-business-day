Cosatu has called on President Jacob Zuma to fire Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini over the looming crisis in the payment of more than 17-million social grants.Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said the crisis at the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) was "disgusting and smells of corruption".The federation said Dlamini should be dismissed or resign, and should take "political responsibility" for the Sassa crisis.Cosatu was briefing the media on the outcome of its three-day central executive committee meeting in Braamfontein.The gulf between the federation and the Zuma-led administration continues to widen.Dlamini is the second minister Cosatu has called on Zuma to act against. After its last CEC it called for action against Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane.Both Dlamini and Zwane are seen as key Zuma allies in the Cabinet.Cosatu reiterated its support for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take over as ANC president at the party s national conference in December.The federation said it was working "on the ground" to ensure its candidate succeeded.Dlamini is also the president of the ANC Women;s League, which in January endorsed Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to take over as ANC president.Cosatu s CEC also mandated federation bosses to agree and sign off on the national minimum wage, set at R20 an hour last month.

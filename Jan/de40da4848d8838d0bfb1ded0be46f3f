On Monday, newly appointed finance minister Malusi Gigaba said "tough and unpopular decisions needed to be made" to ensure radical economic transformation.Gigaba was speaking at a media briefing of the South African Revenue Service (SARS).SARS released its preliminary tax collection figures for the 2016-17 financial year against the backdrop of a downward revision of its target by R30bn.SARS commissioner Tom Moyane said as of midnight on Sunday, the authority collected R1.144-trillion as aligned with the February budget speech.The preliminary estimates showed that SARS had exceeded the mark by R300,000.Moyane said SARS broke the trillion-rand mark for the second year in a row. But growth of 8 6% in refunds outstripped revenue growth of 7%.Moyane added: "This level of precision to achieve revenue estimates have been commented on favourably by the IMF. This achievement reflects a year-on-year growth of 7%, which is normally achieved in boom times."These figures are in the light of SA s 0.3% economic growth in 2016.The tax to GDP ratio was 26%.Gigaba said: "I ve been informed that because of SARS collection efforts, National Treasury was spared from going into market to borrow money in the last few days."Collectively we can achieve the transformation required for the economy.Gigaba said urgent efforts were needed to return the economy to faster growth, inclusively and sustainably, while also working to address unemployment, inequality and poverty.

The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) on Thursday welcomed the DA&rsquo;s call for auditor-general Kimi Makwetu to investigate the "sponsorships" by state-owned enterprises, including Eskom and Transnet.PPF deputy president Kashif Wicomb said the organisation would also be willing to open that process up to the public, while at the at the same time calling on the DA to disclose its own sponsors.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown disclosed in a written reply to a parliamentary question on Tuesday from DA finance spokesman David Maynier that Eskom and Transnet had provided sponsorships of R440,000 and R400,000, respectively, to the PPF.Maynier said what the minister&rsquo;s reply revealed was that Eskom had effectively funded an organisation which was "waging a &lsquo;dirty war&rsquo; on the minister of finance, Pravin Gordhan, and the Treasury, as they probed suspicious contracts entered into by Eskom".Brown said the Eskom sponsorship was for the forum&rsquo;s summit and gala dinners in November 2015 and 2016, while the Transnet sponsorship was also for a conference and gala dinner.Wicomb said on Thursday that Eskom, Transnet, Old Mutual and South African Breweries, among others, had sponsored the 2015 summit and the contributions were recognised. The same was done at the 2016 summit.The companies&rsquo; branding was also clearly displayed at the conference, which he said showed that there was nothing "clandestine" about it.Wicomb questioned why the DA was attacking the PPF, claiming that organisations such as the South African Chamber of Commerce, Afrikaanse Handelinstituut, the Black Management Forum, the Black Business Council and Business Unity SA were also sponsored by Eskom.The PPF accused the DA of being racist and attacking anything done by black people and anything that was an example of black excellence."Although such racially based attacks by the DA are energy draining and counterproductive, PPF finds solace in the attack by the DA as it continues to provide credence to our view that 22 years into democracy, we still have organisations that have betrayed the Madiba dream of a united and prosperous SA," Wicomb said.But Maynier was adamant on Thursday that Eskom and Transnet sponsoring the PPF was "just wrong".This was because, among other things, it involved public funds from state-owned enterprises, which were cash-strapped, and that the parastatals had supported organisations that were deeply involved in politics and "campaigns against" Gordhan."We are not going to sit back and allow state departments, state-owned enterprises and public entities to be used as washing machines to recycle public funds to organisations pursuing political agendas on behalf of factions in the ruling party, or on behalf of families supporting factions in the ruling party, as it heads towards the ANC 54th elective conference," he said.

On Thursday, President Jacob Zuma dodged questions in Parliament about whether he had helped his relatives secure government contracts.Allegations emerged in August that Zuma had initiated and fostered several relationships between Cabinet ministers and his relatives to secure government contracts and other financial benefits for himself and his family."I have never done such a thing," Zuma said in a terse reply to a question by DA leader Mmusi Maimane.Maimane referred to an affidavit submitted to National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete s office by Brent Simons, a chief director in the Department of Public Service and Administration, and an ANC member, which detailed how the President influenced the awarding of contracts to his family.In the affidavit, Simons said he had been present when Zuma sent his relatives to Cabinet ministers, "with a clear instruction to help these family members secure contracts where possible"."If Simons is lying are you going to take legal action?" asked Maimane.But Zuma dodged the question. "I have answered the question," Zuma said, a response that elicited angry objections from opposition MPs."He must answer the question, otherwise this is a sham and we might as well pack it up," said DA chief whip John Steenhuisen.But Mbete leapt to Zuma s defence. "He has answered the question the way he wanted to answer," said Mbete.In a supplementary question, EFF leader Julius Malema asked why Zuma had not taken any legal action against people who were "putting you at the centre of state capture", if the claims were not true."People every day say something about Zuma in the country; should I stand here and take everyone to court? You [Malema] say things about me, but I don t take people like you to court," Zuma said.A collection of e-mail correspondence between the Gupta family and their associates including Cabinet ministers and Zuma s son Duduzane Zuma have shown how the Guptas with the aid of some government ministers have looted state-owned entities and influenced government operations.Earlier, the EFF disrupted the start of Zuma s question-and-answer session in Parliament. The party had boycotted the sessions in Parliament since 2016, saying that it did not recognise him as the country s president and wanted him to resign.But the opposition party resolved to attend Thursday s sitting to hold Zuma to account.The party constantly raised points of order and privilege, delaying the start of the question-and-answer session by about 30 minutes.Zuma s appearance in Parliament was his first following the vote on the motion of no confidence debate earlier in August.

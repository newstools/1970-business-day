The yield on the R207 was at 7.77% from 7.84%.The yield on the benchmark R186 bond steepened through the 9% mark for first time since December in intraday trade on Tuesday, after S&amp;P Global Ratings stripped the country of its investment status on a foreign-currency basis, on Monday night.Analysts said the bond market s reaction was crucial to alleviate the negative consequences of S&amp;P s downgrade. Higher bond yields will increase the interest payments on government debt, threatening the government s stated policy of fiscal consolidation.Old Mutual Multi-Managers investment strategist Izak Odendaal said although the public tended to focus on the rand s reaction to political events, what really mattered in the long term was the bond market s response."Weaker bonds, or higher bond yields, imply that the government and the private sector would have to pay more for borrowing or rolling over debt," Odendaal said.The government spends about R160bn per year on interest payments at present, on its total issued debt of R2.2-trillion."When you owe that much money, your creditors will impose discipline on you one way or another, irrespective of who the finance minister is," Odendaal said.US treasuries were slightly weaker. The yield on the benchmark 10-year was at 2.3374% from 2.3221%.

Geneva &mdash; Volvo Car Group unveiled its new XC60 SUV at the Geneva car show on Tuesday, the latest launch in a sweeping overhaul of its model line-up under Chinese ownership that will be key to driving sales and earnings ahead of a possible listing.Despite being launched almost a decade ago, the original XC60 has remained popular among buyers and been the cat maker&rsquo;s best-selling model since 2009.It accounts for roughly a third of Volvo&rsquo;s sales, leaving the new model with big shoes to fill as it tries to expand its niche in a premium market dominated by larger players such as Daimler&rsquo;s Mercedes-Benz and BMW."The XC60 is in one of the hottest premium segments globally, so getting the execution and launch right is imperative for the growth of the brand," said Bill Rinna, senior manager for North American forecasts at consultancy LMC Automotive."Globally, we expect the new XC60 to sell 175,000 units annually. Its two main competitors are not standing still however, as both the Audi Q5 and BMW X3 have or will be getting updates of their own."Volvo sold just over 161,000 XC60s last year.Over the past few years, the group has begun delivering new models developed since its purchase by China&rsquo;s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford in 2010, including the larger XC90 SUV and a new 90-series.Volvo is banking on a joint platform developed under Geely&rsquo;s ownership for all but its smallest models, key to keeping down costs and improving flexibility for a small group like Volvo.Later this year, it is launching the XC40 compact SUV, aiming to further capitalise on a strong market for SUVs."Now we are really entering into a segment that should deliver volume," said Volvo Car Group CE Hakan Samuelsson. "Before the end of the year we will have the biggest line-up of SUVs we&rsquo;ve ever had."After struggling under Ford, sales at one of Sweden&rsquo;s largest companies by sales and staff have risen sharply, hitting a record 534,332 cars last year.Samuelsson has said he expects 2017 will set a record for the fourth year running on the way to its target of 800,000 cars a year.Volvo has also taken steps toward a possible listing, raising $557m through the sale of newly issued preference shares, though Samuelsson has said any flotation is a question for its owner.The new XC60 will be delivered with a range of powertrains, including a plug-in hybrid version, with production set to begin in mid-April at the Volvo plant in Torslanda, on the outskirts of Gothenburg in western Sweden.A semiautonomous driver-assistance system, which handles steering, acceleration and braking on well-marked roads at speeds up to 130kmh, will be available as an option.Reuters

National Assembly committees chairman Cedric Frolick has asked portfolio committees with oversight of ministers and departments implicated in the state capture allegations to urgently investigate them and report back to the house.The DA has slammed the move as a "cynical" ploy to subvert its proposal for an over-arching parliamentary ad hoc committee to investigate all the allegations of state capture by the Guptas in a holistic way.The proposal was due to be considered at Wednesday s forum of chief whips.EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu and United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa also stressed the importance of having one inquiry by an ad hoc committee as this would give a clearer picture of the entirety of state capture.Shivambu said Parliament and its committees needed to do their work and should not focus only on state capture claims.The public enterprises committee had already decided to conduct its own inquiry into alleged irregularities at Eskom and will work on the terms of reference and modus operandi at a meeting on Wednesday.On Tuesday the home affairs committee will begin a probe into allegations that former home affairs minister and current Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba had broken the rules in expediting the naturalisation of members of the Gupta family.Frolick wrote to the chairs of the committees on home affairs, mineral resources, public enterprises and transport. No deadline has been set but the committees have been urged to report to the house "urgently".Frolick said he would meet the committee chairs later this week to discuss time frames. The probes were the first step towards "opening up the communication", he said.Holomisa said he believed Frolick was "jumping the gun", as Parliament was a multiparty system and he should have referred his proposal to the rules or programming committees.Shivambu also questioned where Frolick had got his mandate as a common approach by all parties was required.

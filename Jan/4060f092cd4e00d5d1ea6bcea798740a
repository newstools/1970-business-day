Durban was stripped of the right to stage the 2022 Commonwealth Games on Monday after a trail of missed deadlines and financial problems, which highlight the burdens facing host cities of major sporting events.The Commonwealth Games Federation said the city had failed to meet the promises contained in its bid and the search for a replacement host was on.Africa has never hosted the Games, which take place every four years and bring together athletes from the 52 members of the Commonwealth.The writing had been on the wall for several weeks after Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula said the projected costs were more than the flagging economy could afford and talks to cut the budget had stalled.The news that Durban had been stripped of the right to host the Games was met with mixed reactions. It was the only city to launch a formal bid to host the Games after Canada&rsquo;s Edmonton withdrew in 2015.SA would have spent R8bn on the event, according to the organisers. It was expecting revenue of more than R11bn in direct investment as athletes, coaches, delegations, spectators and tourists visited the city.On Monday, eThekwini municipality said that although the news was sad, the city could not commit itself to host an event it could not afford."From the hospitality perspective, it is a disappointment because the hotels would have been full and business would have been good during the Games," said Charles Preece, spokesman for the Federated Hospitality Association of SA."However, all things considered, I think Durban could not afford the Games and the money would be better utilised elsewhere. If the economy was growing and the country could have afforded the Games, it would have been good exposure for Durban."Gideon Sam, the president of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee, said: "This is a huge disappointment for us and for the whole African continent."But without the necessary government guarantees, we couldn t move on."The setback follows a series of withdrawals by potential Olympic Games hosts on the grounds of cost and disruption. Boston, Hamburg, Rome and Budapest have dropped out of the running for the 2024 Games, leaving only Los Angeles and Paris in contention."Everybody was very excited to see the Commonwealth Games staged in Durban, which was very well-equipped to host the event, but once the economics started to play a role, it became difficult," Sam said."We had hoped to make this a Games for all of Africa, and so this is a very sad day for the whole continent."

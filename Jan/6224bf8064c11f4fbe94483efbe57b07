The Gupta family has been advised by their lawyer, Gert van der Merwe, to take legal action against Vytjie Mentor following a Facebook post by the former ANC MP.Mentor claimed that the social grant crisis was designed by Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini so the payment of 17-million grants could be handed to a Gupta-owned company "at the 11th hour"."Everything I write down is true&sbquo;" Mentor said on Monday&sbquo; but refused to divulge her sources, saying she had posted in the public interest.But Van der Merwe hit back, saying that at some point "one had to add at least an e-mail&sbquo; or a note or something" to claims so those who had to react could do so properly.He called her post a "completely baseless and vexatious effort to defame the Gupta family"."She was the instigator in three of four witnesses in the State of Capture report and I have read what she said and read her evidence. It s completely baseless " he said."It s obvious that she has a vendetta against the [Gupta] family. My advice to my client is to have a summons issued against her for the defamation that she so intentionally tried to spread as far and wide as possible " he continued.Van der Merwe said he was also considering launching an application to the courts to interdict Mentor from posting further claims if she could not produce some form of evidence to back them up.Mentor made headlines last year when she posted on Facebook she had been offered a Cabinet position by the Gupta family.TMG Digital

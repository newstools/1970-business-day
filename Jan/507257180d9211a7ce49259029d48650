State-owned gas-to-liquid-fuel company Petrosa projects a loss of R2.2bn in the year to end-March 2016, including R1.1bn in an additional impairment, board members said in Parliament on Tuesday.The company has not yet published its results for the 2016-17 financial year.The forecast loss follows a R14.6bn net operating loss in the 2014-15 year. This included an impairment charge of R14.5bn for the failed offshore Ikhwezi project, which did not deliver the volumes of gas anticipated.PeAdding to the company&rsquo;s fiscal challenges is the R8.8bn shortfall in its decommissioning liability."Current projections indicate that PetroSA will continue to be financially challenged throughout the planning period of 2017-18 to 2020-21 unless drastic interventions are initiated," members of Parliament&rsquo;s energy committee were told in a presentation on PetroSA&rsquo;s turnaround plans.Among the threats to its future sustainability was its limited access to affordable feedstock. Leadership instability was also a challenge.MPs were told that PetroSA had made "significant" progress in converting its gas-to-liquid refinery in Mossel Bay for liquid feedstock.

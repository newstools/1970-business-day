The JSE lost ground on Tuesday as miners suffered from lower commodity prices while a stronger rand in late trade further weakened their cause.Political uncertainty also had an effect on the market as Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba s advisor, Chris Malikane, penned an opinion piece over the weekend encouraging the nationalisation of miners, banks and insurers.Treasury released a statement on Tuesday distancing itself from his comments, saying. "Minister Malusi Gigaba wishes to place on record that the work of the Ministry of Finance will continue to be guided by policies of the ANC, as articulated in conference resolutions and in the 2014 election manifesto. The nationalisation of banks is not government policy."The all share ended the day 1.56% lower at 52,672.80 points and the blue-chip top 40 dropped 1.65%.

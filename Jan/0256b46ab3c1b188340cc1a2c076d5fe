South African authorities have been asked to appear at the International Criminal Court (ICC) on April 7 over the failure to arrest Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir during a visit two years ago, a senior official said on Wednesday.Ayesha Johaar, the acting chief state law adviser, said Pretoria was asked to appear at the Hague-based court for failing to comply with a cooperation request from the tribunal, contrary to the provisions of the treaty establishing the court and which came into force in 2002."It concerns an order of noncompliance by SA as a member state of the ICC and Sudan&rsquo;s president," she said.SA has formally revoked its controversial decision to leave the ICC following last month&rsquo;s North Gauteng High Court ruling that such a move would be unconstitutional because it had failed to properly consult Parliament.Notice of Pretoria s decision to end the withdrawal process was posted on the UN s treaty website this week, although it does not necessarily spell the end of its bid to leave the Hague-based court.SA had in October announced it would withdraw from the UN court which was set up to try the world s worst crimes following a dispute sparked by its refusal to arrest visiting Bashir.The ICC had issued an arrest warrant for Bashir over alleged war crimes, but South African authorities refused to detain him, saying he had immunity as a head of state. He denies accusations of genocide and war crimes.Late last year, Gambia had notified the UN it was withdrawing from the ICC in a process which was swiftly reversed under the government of new President Adama Barrow, who took office in January.Burundi has also registered to leave, while Kenya is considering following suit.Currently, nine out of 10 ICC investigations concern African countries, with the only other case concerning Georgia.However, experts point out that many of the current cases in Central African Republic, Uganda, Mali and DRC were referred to the ICC by the governments of those states.Bashir has evaded arrest since his ICC indictment in 2009 for alleged war crimes in Sudan s Darfur conflict in which 300,000 people were killed and 2-million forced to flee their homes.The South African government s decision not to arrest him was denounced as "disgraceful conduct" by the country s Supreme Court which also ruled that the failure to arrest the Sudanese leader was unlawful.The court is unable to carry out investigations in countries which have not ratified its founding Rome Statute unless the UN refers a case for investigation.Reuters and AFP

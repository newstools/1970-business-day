The SABC dropped a bombshell late last night with its 2015-16 annual report &mdash; and it&rsquo;s a big deal. In Cape Town on Wednesday&sbquo; the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) took the SABC&rsquo;s executives to task as they asked difficult questions about expensive issues, among them:1. Hlaudi&rsquo;s salary: According to the financial statements&sbquo; former chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng earned R4.1m. Broken down this is a R2.5m basic salary&sbquo; a 13th cheque of R213,000&sbquo; expenses and other allowances of R945,000 and employer&rsquo;s contribution to medical aid and pension funds of R485,000.2. Irregular spending: The auditor-general found a total of R5.1bn in irregular&sbquo; wasteful and fruitless expenditure &mdash; a complicated accumulation of money spent without following correct policies and procedures in 2015 and 2016. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of how that money was spent:&bull; Payments without a contract in place &mdash; R40.9m (compared to R13.4m in 2015)&bull; Procurement processes not followed &mdash; R16.2m (down from R62.9m last year)&bull; No original tax certificate at date of award &mdash; R142.3m (down from R308.9m in 2015)&bull; Inadequate monitoring of contracts/split orders &mdash; R225.9m (up from just R822,000 in 2015).3. Losing it: The SABC filed a total loss of R411.6m by the end of March 2016&sbquo; compared to a loss of R131.37m for the same period the previous year.4. Big bucks: The largest amount listed under expenditures is for "employee and directors compensation and benefit expenses" which totaled R3.2bn out of a R7.9bn total revenue. It cost the SABC more than R1bn to collect this revenue.5. Criminals at the SABC: According to MPs, who were asking some difficult questions&sbquo; the auditor-general&rsquo;s report found the SABC had no idea which of its employees had criminal records. Acting CEO James Aguma responded to questions saying he would have to "get a full report from the human resources department on that".TMG Digital

The rand was relatively stable on Wednesday morning, but was still 2% weaker to the dollar from Monday morning, highlighting that a weaker trend remains intact.As recently as last week, the local currency was hovering around R12.56/$ before the controversial new version of the Mining Charter knocked sentiment.Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane s controversial recommendations to change the mandate of the Reserve Bank, which is highly regarded by the rating agencies, pushed the currency through R13/$."There is no doubt in my mind that the rand must weaken longer term with all the global and domestic pressures in play but after the currency has lost over 2% this week alone, there is decent potential for a minor recovery," Standard Bank trader Warrick Butler said.The weaker rand has a potential to counter the positive effect of the lower oil price, which is hovering at November lows close to $45 a barrel.At 9am the rand was at R13.0516 to the dollar from R13.0895, R14.5270 to the euro from R14.5651 and at R16.4598 to the pound from R16.5336.The euro was at $1.1131, from $1.1127.

Let s give them space to work on the matter without any [undue] influence, he told Business Day on Monday.The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution said it had written to Matakata on Monday, asking for an update on what the Hawks were investigating. We need the Hawks to act and they should be investigating these things and they should be verifying some of the information that is in the e-mails, saying, well if this is true then this constitutes a criminal offence and therefore we have to take it further , the council s Lawson Naidoo said.He said if the Hawks failed to investigate this matter, the unit had to be held accountable.On Sunday, City Press reported that law enforcement agencies were intensifying investigations into allegations that the Guptas moved billions of rand out of SA. The newspaper said it had obtained documents showing the Hawks were investigating former Eskom group CEO Brian Molefe and President Jacob Zuma s son Duduzane.

London &#8212; Cricket SA (CSA) is advertising for a head coach even as the national team is reeling from one poor result to the next in England.In a notice that runs to 730 words&#8218; CSA&#8217;s website says the board is &quot;considering the position of the Proteas&#8217; head coach until at least the end of the 2019 &#8230; World Cup&quot;.This might come as news to the incumbent&#8218; Russell Domingo&#8218; who was asked on Sunday whether he had clarity over his situation. &quot;No&#8218;&quot; Domingo replied.Had he applied for the job?&quot;No&#8218; not yet&#8218; no.&quot;Could he say if he was interested in taking the team to the 2019 World Cup?&quot;Can&#8217;t say.&quot;Did he have any thoughts of what he may do a few months from now if he was not longer SA&#8217;s coach?&quot;No thoughts yet.&quot;If Domingo wants to stay in the job &#8212; which Faf du Plessis&#8218; AB de Villiers and Dean Elgar have said they want him to do &#8212; he had better get a move on: applications close on Friday.CSA has appointed a committee consisting of two of Domingo&#8217;s predecessors&#8218; Gary Kirsten and Eric Simons&#8218; and administrators Norman Arendse&#8218; Rihan Richards and Oupa Nkagisang&#8218; to find and recommend candidates to the board.And all this while SA&#8218; who have lost the one-day series in England and shambled out of the Champions Trophy in embarrassing fashion with a crushing loss to India at The Oval on Sunday&#8218; are trying to focus on the T20 series that starts in Southampton next Wednesday, as well as next month&#8217;s test series.Not for the first time&#8218; the suits are complicit in complicating what needs to happen on the field.

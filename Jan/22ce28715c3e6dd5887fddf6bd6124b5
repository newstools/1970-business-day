Boston Crude oil edged back from a five-week high on Tuesday as rising US shale oil production weighed against support from tensions in the Middle East and production cuts in Opec and other states.Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil, was down 33 cents from its previous close at $55.55 per barrel at 3.38pm GMT. Earlier in the session, Brent had climbed to its highest since March 7 at $56.16.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 19 cents to $52.88 a barrel, after touching a five-week high of $53.23.Brent has risen in each of the previous six sessions, while WTI gained for the last five days.Analysts said there are worries demand growth could falter, and other indicators were warning that the market had not yet cleared enough of its surplus to keep prices rising."There s a lot of heightened geopolitical tension on two fronts," said Phil Streible, senior market strategist at RJO futures in Chicago.

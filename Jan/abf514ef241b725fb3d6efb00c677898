Auckland The British and Irish Lions opening match of their tour of New Zealand against the Provincial Barbarians on Saturday will be keenly watched for many reasons, but for captain Sam Warburton it will be more about shaking out the cobwebs.The 28-year-old Welshman came into the tour after suffering a knee injury while playing for Cardiff a little less than two months ago. He was given a six-week recovery time.Warburton beat the clock and was able to train with the squad in their pre-tour camps before the side left for New Zealand but he still felt that he would need to run himself back into match fitness over the next couple of weeks."It s really nice to get the ball rolling," Warburton told reporters in Auckland on Thursday. "I will need a good few games before I start hitting my straps but we all know that every game is a huge audition for the Test matches."His knee injury could have prompted a sense of d j vu for the loose forward. Named to lead the Lions on their tour to Australia in 2013, the then 24-year-old had to sit out the opening two fixtures because of a knee injury. He did not appear until the third game against the Reds and by that stage was itching to get his hands on his first Lions jersey."It really felt I was chasing it four years ago. I was the last guy on the tour to play a fixture so it s nice to get a jersey in the kit bag," he said.Warburton s side have arrived in New Zealand with huge expectations but only one other Lions team, Carwyn James s 1971 side, have clinched a series against the All Blacks. So the opening match against players from New Zealand s semi-professional provincial competition will be eagerly watched as a sign of what to expect from the touring party.Do they have the depth required to get through an arduous tour that includes matches against all five Super Rugby teams? Will they have enough time to gel combinations before the first Test on June 24?Despite the limited buildup because of club commitments, coach Warren Gatland said he had chosen his side last week and they had spent much of it training together.Gatland, however, was reminded how serious the tour was being taken with the selection of the team to face the Barbarians already described as "a shambles"."The opening selections of the tour [are] a shambles," British rugby columnist Mark Reason wrote for Fairfax Media. "It is paramount he finds his combinations as quickly as possible."Gatland only has two more Saturdays after this one before the first Test. He needs to start finding his combinations or the All Blacks will take his team apart."Reuters

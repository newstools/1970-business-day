Energy Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi has launched an investigation against several senior officials in her department for alleged nuclear tender irregularities amounting to R80m.Kubayi s office has confirmed it is probing the possible violation of National Treasury regulations in awarding the contract to nuclear transactional advisor Mahlako a Phalala Investments (MAP)."There are still investigations going on about the matters raised in your questions and therefore we are unable to respond as it will jeopardise and weaken the case " said a short statement from Kubayi s office in response to 29 questions from TimesLIVE.The minister can expect heavy questioning on the matter from DA MP Gordon Mackay when she appears before Parliament s portfolio committee on energy on Tuesday. Mackay said this was further evidence that the government nuclear procurement was captured."The nuclear deal is a prime example of state capture. The DA will demand from committee chairperson, Fikile Majola, that the energy portfolio committee tackle this matter with extreme urgency when we reconvene next month and question the investment," he said. "We will also demand to know why deputy director-general [Zizamele] Mbambo remains in his post and will propose an ad hoc committee to get to the bottom of this mess."According to documents TimesLIVE has seen energy director-general Thabane Zulu his deputy Zizamele Mbambo procurement specialist Ndaba Ngwane and chief financial officer Yvonne Chetty signed a deviation request to sign off the deal.Zulu has since been moved to head the Strategic Energy Fund while Ndaba has quietly exited the department. Mbambo remains in his position despite awarding the R80m contract shown in a leaked document.The scandal started at the end of August 2016 when one of the consulting firms in the nuclear build programme MAP against which no allegations are made compiled a report finding that the department was not ready to issue a request for proposal for the intended nuclear new-build programme estimated to be worth R1-trillion.On September 22 Mbambo and Ngwane requested that Chetty and Zulu approve a deviation from normal procurement processes and allow MAP to continue work on the development of a transactional advisor. The next day Chetty and Zulu agreed to the deviation which Chetty warned was subject to the buy-in of the National Treasury and the office of the attorney-general.However Mbambo and Ngwane told MAP to continue with a second phase of the contract the cost of which would grow by R80m to R100m by March, despite the required governance processes allegedly not being followed.On September 27 then energy minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson suspended all payments related to MAP until the department submitted a verification report to her on all deliverables received. According to sources close to the events this decision was never communicated to MAP. Instead Mbambo Zulu and Ngwane continued to engage MAP and received work deliverables towards the procurement process without a contract and without all regulations being followed.Among the serious allegations TimesLIVE put to the department of energy over the past 10 days is that MAP was not subjected to a competitive bid process. Instead Section 16 (a) 6.6 of the Public Finance Management Act was used despite warnings by the relevant tender committee that this was wrong to keep paying MAP. This was done despite the law only allowing for the cost of the project to be extended by 15% without an open tender process.At the beginning of March MAP which remained ignorant of Joemat-Pettersson s instruction to stop payments went to see her about outstanding payments adding R60m to the initial R20m contract. MAP also revealed to Joemat-Pettersson that they had a copy of the deviation request approved by Chetty and Zulu, as given to them by Mbambo and Ndaba despite the strict rules regarding leaking of internal documents.The matter came to a climax on March 16 2017 when the departmental tender committee met and had sight of MAP s bills.Mbambo was held to account as the meeting continued on March 22. During the meeting it came to light that Mbambo had, on September 1, given verbal instruction to MAP to extend its contract by a further R80m.In the end the department of energy shifted funds from the sundries account and paid MAP R56m of the additional R80m by the end of the financial year (March 31).Zulu said only the department of energy could comment. Numerous efforts to contact Mbambo for comment failed last week and Ngwane could not be tracked down.

Wayde van Niekerk says he was nervous before breaking Michael Johnson&#8217;s 300m world best in Ostrava&#8218; despite having run personal best times in the 200m and 100m in the weeks before.The Olympic 400m champion slashed four-hundredths of a second off the American legend&#8217;s 30.85sec mark as he cantered to victory by nearly a second.His 30.81 obliterated Usain Bolt&#8217;s 30.97 meet record.&quot;It was a nervy buildup obviously because I&#8217;ve been avoiding the 300s and 400s so I&#8217;m glad I finally got to break through that&#8218;&quot; said Van Niekerk&#8218; who races his first international 400m in Switzerland on Thursday next week.&quot;It&#8217;s a good step towards the 400m in Lausanne and I&#8217;m feeling quite positive and confident and let&#8217;s see how it goes.&quot;I think we&#8217;ve got to keep on working and keep on improving&#8218;&quot; added Van Niekerk&#8218; who is based in Gemona&#8218; Italy&#8218; during the European summer.

Pravin Gordhan says he is still SA&rsquo;s finance minister.Gordhan arrived at the High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday afternoon, where his application for a declaratory order preventing him from intervening in the situation between the banks and Gupta-linked companies, was being heard.When the media asked him if he was still minister, Gordhan replied: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;He would not answer a question about whether he had resigned. Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas arrived with him but left shortly afterwards.Gordhan&rsquo;s tenure as finance minister &mdash; his second stint in the job &mdash; has been under threat since he took over from now Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen in December 2015.Gordhan and President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s acrimony has played out on several fronts, and Gordhan has operated under constant threat of arrest or removal.He was subjected to an investigation by the Hawks early in 2016 over an alleged &ldquo;rogue unit&rdquo; at SARS, and in October faced the threat of arrest on fraud charges. Those charges were dropped.In the matter of the Guptas and the banks, Gordhan was seeking a declaratory order confirming that he was not empowered to intervene in the banks&rsquo; decision to close the accounts of Gupta companies.A high court hearing of that matter was under way, in which Zuma&rsquo;s attempt to intervene as an &ldquo;interested party&rdquo; was turned down.Gordhan was at the forefront of SA&rsquo;s attempts to stave off several credit rating downgrades in the past year-and-a-half, so his recall from the UK roadshow and the threat of his removal has spooked investors.

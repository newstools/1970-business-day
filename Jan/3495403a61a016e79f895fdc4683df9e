The Save SA campaign would like to see President Jacob Zuma hauled before Parliament to explain his "unbridled recklessness" in calling Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas back from an overseas investment roadshow."These visits have been carefully planned with business and labour as part of South Africa&rsquo;s efforts to stave off a downgrade of our sovereign investment status," Save SA said. "It is an initiative that the president himself has endorsed."The order for the minister and his deputy to return immediately from London has put political risk back in the spotlight &mdash; with a rating review by Moody&rsquo;s imminent &mdash; and the rand weakened in response on Monday.After hitting a new 20-month best level of R12.31 against the dollar in opening trade, the rand plunged more than 4% or 52c to an intraday worst level of R12.8295/$ in afternoon trade.Save SA said: "A rapidly depreciating rand has a massive impact on the South African economy, and its ability to effect economic transformation, whether radical or not. The ultimate victims will be the poor, and Zuma must be held accountable for his style of politics."It is clear that he has no concern for South Africa, its image abroad, or the people who will suffer the consequences. Parliament should summon the President to explain and account for his actions.Equal Education put aside its policy differences with Treasury, saying: "We will oppose any Cabinet reshuffle that seeks to replace these honest officials with those who will do the bidding of President Zuma s self-enriching friends."It said it was "clear-eyed about the difference between a Treasury with which we have policy and ideological differences and a Treasury that becomes a feeding trough for looting and corruption".Labour federation Fedusa s general secretary would not cancel his plan to travel to London to take part in the roadshow."Engaging credit rating agencies and investors is important for the country to ensure rapid inclusive economic growth and the creation of decent jobs for our people," Dennis George said."It is always important for social partners to work together to give hope to our people and to deliver a single, positive narrative about the country when dealing with investors and credit rating agencies".If social partners were not working together to confront the myriad of structural challenges facing SA, it would imply they were working against each other, which would be self-destructive, he said.The South African Institute for Race Relations said the move was "designed to publicly humiliate and weaken the so-called Western Bloc of the ruling party that is aligned with the Deputy President and the Minister of Finance".It said that depending on how markets reacted to the move it could be a precursor to the axing of Gordhan and a broader Cabinet reshuffle.With TMG Digital

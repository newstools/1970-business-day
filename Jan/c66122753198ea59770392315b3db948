The City of Cape Town says it is taking "proactive steps" by declaring a disaster area, with only 113 days of usable water left before taps run dry.Last week Western Cape head of water and sanitation Rashid Khan said Cape Town was in the "orange", meaning it had more than three months of water left and the department would not declare it a disaster area.But on Monday&sbquo; the city announced that executive mayor Patricia de Lille declared a "local disaster" through an executive order under section 55 of the Disaster Management Act&sbquo; and the council was not consulted.So what does this mean? Some of the steps the city is allowed to take includes the: Suspension or limiting of the sale dispensing or transportation of alcoholic beverages within the disaster-stricken or threatened area; Regulation of traffic to from or within the disaster-stricken or threatened area; Maintenance or installation of temporary lines of communication to from or within the disaster area; Control and occupancy of premises in the disaster-stricken or threatened area; Release of any available resources of the municipality including stores equipment vehicles and facilities; Release of personnel of the municipality for the rendering of emergency services; Implementation of all or any of the provisions of a municipal disaster management plan that are applicable in the circumstances; Evacuation to temporary shelters of all or part of the population from the disaster-stricken or threatened area if such action is necessary for the preservation of life; Regulation of the movement of persons and goods to from or within the disaster-stricken or threatened area; Provision control or use of temporary emergency accommodation and Dissemination of information required for dealing with the disaster.TMG Digital

The rand was weaker against the dollar in late afternoon trade on Tuesday, as the dollar gained against the euro and pound before the US Federal Reserve&rsquo;s rate announcement on Wednesday.The rand firmed against the pound.The Fed was expected to hike rates, but the dollar has traded weaker since the end of last week on a less dovish stance by the European Central Bank (ECB).A firmer dollar was an indication that currency markets were expecting a more hawkish Fed view on further interest-rate rises this year. An increase on Wednesday was nearly a foregone conclusion."Should the Fed renege on a rate hike that policy makers have strongly hinted at, then the potential downside could be quite substantial," Oanda analyst Craig Erlam said.He said the most important thing should be the projections, and Fed chair Janet Yellen&rsquo;s expectations in the future."Should the Fed signal a possible fourth hike this year, then further upside could be in store for the dollar and treasuries&rsquo; yields," Erlam said.At 4.40pm the rand was at R13.1801 against the dollar from R13.1369.The rand was at R14.0167 against the euro from R13.9955 and at R16.0290 against the pound from R16.051.The euro was at $1.0635 from $1.0654.The pound was at $1.2161 from $1.2220.This followed the UK parliament&rsquo;s clearing the way for Article 50 to be initiated, and Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon&rsquo;s call for a second Scottish independence referendum, with the market taking the view May could opt for a hard Brexit option.

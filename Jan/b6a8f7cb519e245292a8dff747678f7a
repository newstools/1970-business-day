The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) on Tuesday handed over to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) the dockets of investigations into the shooting of 34 mineworkers at Lonmin&#8217;s Marikana Mine by the police in 2012.The 34 workers were shot dead on August 16 2012 at the mine following a violent protest as miners demanded an increase in their salaries. Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini confirmed that the dockets had been sent on Tuesday, while NPA spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku confirmed receipt of the dockets.Mfaku said prosecutors would now peruse the dockets and decide whether there were still outstanding investigations to be pursued or not. If there were still issues outstanding, the dockets would be sent back to Ipid, Mfaku said. The dockets of the August 16 massacre had earlier been sent back to Ipid for further investigation. In all 47 people died during the protests five years ago, including four security guards and two police officers.

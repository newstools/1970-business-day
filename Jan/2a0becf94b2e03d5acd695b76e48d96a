Another politician has splashed out on expensive wheels&sbquo; despite the government telling taxpayers it is cutting down spending on frills.The Public Service and Administration Deputy Minister Ayanda Dlodlo spent nearly R1.5m on two cars in the space of 18 days.This was disclosed in reply to a parliamentary question posed by DA MP Desiree Van Der Walt.On June 2 2016&sbquo; an Audi A8 3.0 TDI Quatrro Tip-tronic was purchased for R750&sbquo;000 and on June 20 2016&sbquo; an Audi A7 Sportback 3.0 TDI Tip-tronic was purchased for R735&sbquo;700."It is wasteful expenditure like this that has created the lost generation&sbquo; the millions of young people that have given up on ever finding work because the ANC would rather spend money on fancy cars than on quality basic education and skills development for our young people," Van Der Walt said in a statement."The DA will not let this shocking abuse of public money stand, and calls on Deputy Minister Dlodlo to return the cars and opt for a more appropriate one."TMG Digital

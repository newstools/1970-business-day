Washington &mdash; US President Donald Trump signed a revised executive order on Monday banning citizens from six Muslim-majority nations from travelling to the US but removing Iraq from the list, after his controversial first attempt was blocked in the courts.The new order, which the White House said Trump had signed, keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the US by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the new order would take effect on March 16. The delay aims to limit the disruption created by the original January 27 order before a US judge suspended it on February 3.Trump, who first proposed a temporary travel ban on Muslims during his presidential campaign last year, had said his original executive order was a national security measure meant to head off attacks by Islamist militants. It came only a week after Trump was inaugurated, and it sparked chaos and protests at airports, as well as a wave of criticism from targeted countries, Western allies and some of America&rsquo;s leading corporations."It is the president&rsquo;s solemn duty to protect the American people," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said after Trump signed the new order. "As threats to our security continue to evolve and change, common sense dictates that we continually re-evaluate and reassess the systems we rely upon to protect our country."The leader of the minority Democrats in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he expected the revised order to have the same uphill battle in the courts as the original version."A watered down ban is still a ban," he said in a statement. "Despite the administration&rsquo;s changes, this dangerous executive order makes us less safe, not more, it is mean-spirited, and un-American. It must be repealed."Iraq&rsquo;s New VettingIraq was taken off the banned list because the Iraqi government has imposed new vetting procedures, such as heightened visa screening and data sharing, and because of its work with the US in countering Islamic State militants, a senior White House official said.Thousands of Iraqis have fought alongside US troops for years or worked as translators since the US-led invasion in 2003. Many have resettled in the US after being threatened for working with US troops.Trump s first order was seen by opponents as discrimination against Muslims but the White House official said the new order was based on national security concerns and had nothing to do with religion."It is substantially different from the first order yet it will do the same thing in this important way: It will protect the country and keep us safe," the official said. The administration would reset the clock on the 90-day travel ban.The White House official said the new executive order also ensured that tens of thousands of legal permanent residents in the US or green card holders from the listed countries would not be affected by the travel ban.Trump s original travel ban resulted in more than two dozen lawsuits in US courts. The state of Washington succeeded in having it suspended by the 9th Circuit court of Appeals by arguing that it violated constitutional protections against religious discrimination."No Alleged Chaos"Trump publicly criticised judges who ruled against him and vowed to fight the case in the Supreme Court, but then decided to draw up a new order with changes aimed at making it easier to defend in the courts.Reuters

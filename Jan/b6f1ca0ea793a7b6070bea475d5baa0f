New York Declines in financial and energy shares weighed on US and European equity markets on Wednesday, while the US Treasury yield curve hit the narrowest in nearly a decade as investors evaluated hawkish Federal Reserve policy and deteriorating inflation measures.The US S&amp;P 500 financial sector was last down about 0.4% while the European Stoxx Europe 600 Financial Services index was down 1.3%. The financial sector fell as the US Treasury yield curve held near 10-year lows.A drop in oil prices to near seven-month lows also put pressure on energy shares as investors discounted evidence that major producers are sticking to a deal to cut output. The US Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend, rising on gains in biotechnology stocks.So far this year, oil has lost 20% in value, its weakest performance for the first six months of the year since 1997. Brent crude was last down 43 cents, or 0.93%, at 45.59 a barrel. US crude was down 33c, or 0.76%, at 43.18 per barrel."Oil has perhaps tempered some sentiment near-term," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

Five-year note yields, which are highly sensitive to rate policy, rose to a four-week high of 1.80% on Tuesday.Thirty-year bond yields, which are largely driven by future expectations of growth and inflation, meanwhile dropped to 2.72% on Wednesday, the lowest since November 9."I think the market may be pricing in a little higher odds of another rate hike before the end of the year, and that is helping drive some of the flattening," said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.Hawkish comments from the Bank of England s chief economist Andy Haldane were also seen as hurting short-term bonds on Wednesday.The dollar edged higher against the yen after data showed US existing home sales posted a surprise increase in May, soothing some concerns about a real estate slowdown.Gold steadied after sliding to a five-week low in the previous session.

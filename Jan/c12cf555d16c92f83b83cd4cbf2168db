MSCI&rsquo;s all-country world stock index was off 0.08%. The likelihood the Fed will raise rates has not spooked investors, unlike the "taper tantrum" of 2013, because they perceive the economy is strong enough to withstand a rate hike and they see the need for a more normalized monetary policy."Even if the Fed raises rates next week, it would be to 75 basis points which is historically very low and is still considered very easy money," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments in Orlando, Florida.The benchmark S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes rose, while the Dow industrials fell, pulled lower by Caterpillar Inc and Merck &amp; Co.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.5 points, or 0.02%, to 20,921.26.

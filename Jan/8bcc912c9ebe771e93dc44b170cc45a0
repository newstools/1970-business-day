Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has accused the ANC Youth League of spreading fake news after it accused him of a conflict of interest.In January, the youth league said that Ramaphosa&sbquo; in collusion with Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&sbquo; tried to collapse South African Airways (SAA) so a company linked to the deputy president would benefit&sbquo; according to a report by IOL.In a reply to a question in the National Assembly by IFP MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa&sbquo; Ramaphosa said he had told the youth league that the matter "was a lie&sbquo; was a fabrication and as you say&sbquo; fake news&sbquo; because there is no truth that I am conducting business with SAA or any other company".Ramaphosa said he had disposed of all his shares in the Shanduka group in 2014&sbquo; and therefore had no conflict of interest to declare.TMG Digital

The JSE ended higher on Friday, in contrast to most global markets particularly other emerging markets which slipped as geopolitical concerns and uncertainty about US President Donald Trump s long-term plans, caused investors to shy away from riskier assets.Trump sparked worries about global trade on Thursday after being quoted as saying he would renegotiate or terminate a trade deal with South Korea and that a major conflict with North Korea over its nuclear programme was possible, although he would prefer a diplomatic solution.Trade on the JSE on Friday was subdued ahead of a long weekend, with the markets closed on Monday for Workers Day.

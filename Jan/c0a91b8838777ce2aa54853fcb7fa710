Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi says the work of the presidential review committee will hold transport entities and their leaders accountable for their performance, while insisting that their performance is "above average".The briefing on Friday in Pretoria came after the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) incurred the highest irregular and unauthorised expenditure in its existence, the embattled South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) received a downgrade from ratings agencies, and in the midst of calls for a Parliamentary probe into state capture in the light of President Jacob Zuma s controversial relationship with the Gupta family.Maswanganyi said while there were challenges at various entities, the majority of them were performing well. He said in the 2015-16 Prasa achieved 45% of its pre-determined objectives compared to 35% in the previous financial year."Most of our entities are performing above average; however, there might be those with challenges. We are working with them to assist them. We want to make sure that we live up to giving rail to the people of Moloto and road expansion," Maswanganyi said.Despite facing difficulty in ensuring compliance to Gauteng s electronic tolling system on freeways, Maswanganyi said Sanral attained 99% of its performance targets. The agency also received an unqualified audit opinion from the auditor-general for the thirteenth year in a row, Maswanganyi said.Maswanganyi said through the findings stemming from the presidential review committee s work, the department had resolved to introduce training for staff at the 12 entities as well as systems to incentivise strong performance and good governance."We will improve our investment in training at all levels, from managers and research scientists down to the level of ordinary workers, to improve skills. In this regard, our state-owned enterprises incentives systems will be related to performance," he said.He lauded the Airports Company SA for achieving 96% of its targets, as per its shareholders compact. He said the Road Accident Fund (RAF) reduced outstanding claims to 217,182 in 2016, despite a sharp increase in registered claims."It is encouraging to note that despite the obvious challenges affecting both the country and the RAF in particular, there was an improvement in performance, with the organisation fulfilling 90% of its annual performance plan targets," Maswanganyi said.

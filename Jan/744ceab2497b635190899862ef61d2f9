The JSE closed flat on Friday as retailers and banks gained on the firmer rand while gold stocks and resources closed weaker.Trading was choppy ahead of S&amp;P Global Rating s expected credit rating update, however, S&amp;P affirmed the rating at BBB-while retaining the negative outlook.The rand firmed on a weaker dollar following the release of worse-than-expected US employment data, thereby reducing the chances of an interest-rate increase this month in the US.The rand firmed to R12.7706 to the dollar in intra-day trade and was at R12.82 at the close.The US created 138,000 new jobs in May, much lower than the expected 182,000, with unemployment coming in at 4.3%. Wage growth also disappointed, with average hourly earnings rising a subdued 2.5%.In addition to the disappointing numbers, previous months also saw significant downward revisions. March s 79,000 was reduced to 50,000, while the April number was cut to 174,000 from 211,000. US job growth has averaged 121,000 over the past three months.Stanlib analyst Kevin Lings said the downward revisions to the previous months and stagnant growth in wages are particularly disappointing. "US wage growth needs to be moving strongly higher and this is not really happening," he said.Lings said this would leave the US Federal Reserve a little unsure about the pace of interest-rate normalisation: "Nevertheless, the Fed is still expected to raise rates twice by 25 basis points this year, once in June and again in September."Resources shares, with the exception of platinums, mirrored low commodity prices, with the price of Brent crude slipping nearly 2% to below $50 a barrel amid an ongoing global supply glut.Banks and financial shares, however, rebounded from Thursday s losses with retail stocks also gaining on the strong rand.The Dow Jones was 0.22% higher at the JSE s close.The FTSE 100 had a lacklustre day amid new opinion polls reflecting further progress by Jeremy Corbyn s Labour Party.

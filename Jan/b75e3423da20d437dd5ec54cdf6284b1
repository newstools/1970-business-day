Apparently the ANC, who have requested an urgent meeting with Minister Zwane, have the same concern."The rand, which had strengthened to R12.59/$ on Thursday before Zwane s press conference, was trading at R12.81/$ at 6:50am on Monday morning.Early tallies of the French election on Monday morning indicated President Emmanuel Macron s Republique en Marche! party and its allies won a clear majority of between 350 and 361 seats of the 577-seat national assembly.This buoyed Asian stocks on Monday morning, sending Hong Kong s Hang Seng index up 0.94%, the Shanghai composite index up 0.66% and Tokyo s Nikkei 225 index up 0.62%.

The rand was weaker against the dollar on Thursday afternoon as prospects increased of an interest-rate hike in the US &mdash; a spike in optimism that has led to the dollar strengthening against leading currencies.Momentum SP Reid Securities analysts said a combination of technical factors and a generally positive reaction to US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s speech to congress, had created additional upside for US risk assets.It should, however, be noted that the likelihood of an interest-rate increase had also "sharply increased against a backdrop in which evidence of inflationary pressures in the US economy has emerged".The rand has continued to trade in a resilient manner within a narrow range of between R13.12/$ and R12.99/$.The analysts said their short-term technical studies continued to indicate a strong likelihood of a move weaker beyond R13.20 to the dollar.At 3.34pm the unit was at R13.0993 to the dollar from Wednesday&rsquo;s R13.0259, R13.7715 to the euro from R13.7363, and R16.0935 to the pound from R16.0136.The euro was at $1.0512 from $1.0546.

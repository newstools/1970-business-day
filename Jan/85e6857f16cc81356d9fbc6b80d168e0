The rand was slightly firmer on Tuesday afternoon despite SA&rsquo;s economy having contracted in the last quarter of 2016.Gross domestic product (GDP) for the fourth quarter was 0.3% down on the previous quarter&rsquo;s versus the market expectation of a 0.6% contraction.The negative GDP performance was due largely to mining contracting 11.5% and manufacturing 3.1%.An interesting aspect of GPD figures was the extent of recovery in agricultural output, which had been in recession for two years. Stats SA said the industry&rsquo;s decline of 0 1% in 2016&rsquo;s fourth was due mainly to decreases in the production of horticultural products.The economy grew 0.3% in 2016. MMI Investments and Savings economist Sanisha Packirisamy said GDP had bottomed in 2016, and the growth rate should improve to about 1% in 2017 and 2% in 2018.Packirisamy said higher expected global economic growth should provide a slightly more supportive environment for SA&rsquo;s export activity. A recovery of nearly 20% in global commodity prices over the past 12 months boded well for a mild uptick in SA&rsquo;s beleaguered mining and manufacturing sectors.At 3.30pm, the rand was R12.9524 to the dollar from Monday&rsquo;s R13.0137, R13.6985 to the euro from R13.7717 and R15.8043 to the pound from R15.9290.The euro was at $1.0575 from $1.0582.

The South African bond market tracked the firmer rand on Thursday afternoon.The local currency hit a three-week best level to the dollar in earlier trade with bonds following the positive sentiment. The gains came after Statistics SA reported that consumer inflation fell to 6.1% in March from 6.3% in February, on Wednesday.As with the rand, bonds have defied the prophets of doom by trading resiliently, after losing ground when S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch downgraded the country earlier in April.Bonds usually track the rand.At 3.40pm, the benchmark R186 was bid at 8.685% from a previous 8.78% while the R207 was bid at 7.57% from 7.655%.Futuregrowth portfolio manager Wikus Furstenberg said despite the strength in the local bond market, a defensive investment strategy might be more appropriate for now."The combination of weak economic fundamentals, negative credit ratings momentum and the continued build-up of big nonresident exposure in the market in the search for yield, is potentially lethal for bonds," he said.US treasuries trended weaker, with the yield on the 10-year bond at 2.2314% from 2.2164%.

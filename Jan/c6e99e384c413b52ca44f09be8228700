London &mdash; University of Oxford bosses have said Britain should guarantee the rights of EU citizens after Brexit or Britain&rsquo;s oldest university could suffer enormous damage as academics leave.On Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May will try to rally the House of Commons to back the bill that would empower her to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. But first she is seeking to persuade legislators to overturn the amendments added to it by the House of Lords that would guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK, and give parliament a binding vote on whatever she negotiates with the EU.Some in her own Conservative party are considering backing at least one of those tweaks and Brexit secretary David Davis took to the airwaves on Sunday to press them not to do so in the interest of giving May a free hand in the upcoming talks. "Please don&rsquo;t tie the prime minister&rsquo;s hands," Davis told the BBC.If May can get the bill passed swiftly, will she pull the trigger? She could, in theory, do it as soon as Tuesday. One other option, as reported by Bloomberg, is that she uses that day&rsquo;s parliamentary statement to signal she will wait until the end of the month to do so.Waiting would allow May to avoid obstacles, such as Wednesday&rsquo;s Dutch elections and the March 25 celebration of the EU&rsquo;s founding Treaty of Rome, while keeping to her deadline of acting by the end of the month. It would also enable EU leaders to plan a summit for April 6 at which they would sign off on negotiating guidelines for the European Commission.The heads of 35 Oxford colleges said that EU colleagues were unsettled by the government&rsquo;s refusal to guarantee their status, and that some were making arrangements to leave. "If they lost their right to work here, our university would suffer enormous damage which, given our role in research, would have reverberations across the UK," the academics said in a letter to the Times newspaper.The University of Oxford, whose alumni include May, foreign minister Boris Johnson and finance minister Philip Hammond, was founded more than 900 years ago, and, last month, denied a report that it was considering opening a campus in France in response to Brexit.Bloomberg and Reuters

Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe say the Cabinet has noted the concerns of contracted coal transporters, who fear losing business and jobs to the uptake of renewable energy projects.On Wednesday the truckers blocked roads in Pretoria, as they embarked on industrial action that the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality said had not been cleared to take place.Transporters fear that the falling reliance on coal-fired power stations would have a negative effect on jobs in the sector."Government must act responsibly in its energy planning to ensure sustainable and affordable energy supply. The system relies on a combination of base load, coal and nuclear and intermittent supply of electricity, renewable and gas," Radebe said.He said any changes in the government&rsquo;s reliance on coal should not automatically devastate the coal transporters. The government should strive to be as careful and inclusive as possible in implementing renewable energy projects, Radebe said."It is clear from the draft 2016 Integrated Resource Plan that SA will continue to deploy coal electricity in the energy mix," the minister said.

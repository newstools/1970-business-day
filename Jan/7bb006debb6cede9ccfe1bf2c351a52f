The JSE closed firmer on Wednesday as the rand weakened against the dollar in the late afternoon, creating opportunities for miners and rand hedges to rebound.The local currency had fallen 20c to the dollar in late afternoon trade after US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin confirmed that President Donald Trump intended to lower the business tax rate to 15% from 35% as part of his tax reform plan. The dollar firmed in response, with the rand losing ground after recording gains earlier in the week.Trading was subdued ahead of Freedom Day on Thursday. Regular trading was only expected to resume next Tuesday after Workers Day on May 1, as many traders were expecting to take Friday off.Some technical analysts had expressed scepticism about the rand s revival earlier in the week, saying it was most likely to be short-lived, said Stanlib retail investment director Paul Hansen. "This potentially created an opportunity to buy rand hedges and also invest offshore."Hansen said a high percentage of US fund managers believed the US stock market was over-valued: "With the European economy growing quite nicely now and company earnings recovering, this region looks quite attractive."Spot gold was flat at $1,264.15 an ounce at the JSE s close after some hefty losses during the week. Platinum was 0.40% lower at $951.Local market sentiment was positive following the Cape High Court s decision to throw out government s entire nuclear procurement process, including inter-governmental agreements.

Seoul North Korea fired at least one short-range ballistic missile on Monday that landed in the sea off its east coast, the latest in a fast-paced series of missile tests defying world pressure and threats of more sanctions.The missile was believed to be a Scud-class ballistic missile and flew about 450km, South Korean officials said. North Korea has a large stockpile of the short-range missiles, originally developed by the Soviet Union.Monday s launch followed two successful tests of medium- to long-range missiles in as many weeks by Pyongyang, which has been conducting such tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting the mainland US.The North was probably showing its determination to push ahead with missile development in the face of international pressure to rein it in and "to pressure the (South Korean) government to change its policy on the North", South Korea s joint chiefs of staff spokesperson Roh Jae-cheon said.It was the third ballistic missile test-launch since South Korea s liberal President Moon Jae-in took office on May 10 pledging to engage the reclusive state in dialogue.Moon says sanctions alone have failed to resolve the growing threat from the North s advancing nuclear and missile programme.The missile reached an altitude of 120km, Roh said. "So far, the assessment is there was at least one missile but we are analysing the number of missiles," he said.North Korea, which has conducted dozens of missile tests and tested two nuclear bombs since the start of 2016 in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions, says the programme is necessary to counter US aggression.The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed on the launch. The US Pacific command said it tracked what appeared to be a short-range ballistic missile for six minutes and assessed it did not pose a threat to North America.The US has said it is looking at discussing with China a new UN Security Council resolution and that Beijing, Pyongyang s main diplomatic ally and neighbour, realises time is limited to rein in the North s weapons programme through negotiations.US defence secretary Jim Mattis, asked what a military conflict with North Korea might look like if diplomacy failed, warned on Sunday that would be "probably the worst kind of fighting in most people s lifetimes"."The North Korean regime has hundreds of artillery cannons and rocket launchers within range of one of the most densely populated cities on Earth, which is the capital of South Korea," Mattis told CBS news programme Face the Nation."And in the event of war, they would bring danger to China and to Russia as well," he said.Japan lodged a protest against the North s latest missile launch, which appeared to have landed in Japan s exclusive economic zone.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed action along with other nations to deter Pyongyang s repeated provocations."As we agreed at the recent G-7 [Group of Seven], the issue of North Korea is a top priority for the international community," Abe told reporters in brief televised remarks. "Working with the US, we will take specific action to deter North Korea."Seoul s new liberal administration has said Pyongyang s repeated test launches were dashing hopes for peace on the Korean peninsula.South Korea s Moon swiftly called a meeting of the National Security Council, South Korea s office of the joint chiefs of staff said in a statement.North Korea last test-fired a ballistic missile on May 21 off its east coast and said on Sunday it had tested a new anti-aircraft weapon supervised by leader Kim Jong-un.It has tested Scud-type short-range missiles many times in the past, most recently in April, according to US officials.However, experts say it may be trying to test new capabilities that may be fed into its efforts to build an intercontinental ballistic missile."There are many possibilities.... It could have been a test for a different type of engine. Or to verify the credibility of the main engine for [intercontinental ballistic missile s] first-stage rocket," said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University s Far Eastern Studies department in Seoul.Modified versions of the Scud have a range of up to 1,000km.On Tuesday, the US would test an existing missile defence system to try to intercept an intercontinental ballistic missile, the first such test, officials said last week.South Korean authorities were questioning six North Koreans rescued on the weekend as they drifted in the sea off the east coast, and would send them home if they wanted to go, the South s unification ministry said on Monday.The six are believed to have been on two fishing vessels, one of which was overturned, when they were rescued by the South Korean coast guard and the navy on Saturday, the coast guard said.The six were being questioned by a South Korean team, and would be asked if they wished to be repatriated to the North, unification ministry spokesperson Lee Duk-haeng told a briefing.If so, they would be sent home, said the ministry, which handles ties with the North.Such questioning by South Korean authorities is routine when North Koreans are rescued at sea.The South returned eight North Koreans and their vessels in December after rescuing them off the east coast, in line with their wishes.Lee said incidents such as the rescue and the repatriation of the crew were examples of why an open line of communication between the two Koreas was needed.Reuters

Rating agency Moody's put SA on review for a downgrade late on Monday, saying the abrupt change in leadership of key government institutions raised questions about reforms essential to sustain SA's fiscal and economic strength and could have an immediate impact economic growth and public debt levels.Moody's action, which suggests that a downgrade from the agency is imminent, came just hours after S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded its SA foreign currency rating to sub-investment grade status.Moody s has SA's rating at two notches above sub-investment grade so a one notch cut would not pitch SA into junk territory on the Moody's scale. But economists are suggesting that Moody s could opt for a two notch downgrade. That would mean SA is sub-investment grade on two of the major rating agency scales, putting it into true "junk" territory and forcing a bond sell-off by foreign investors whose mandates limit them to investment-grade assets only.Moody s is due for a scheduled announcement on its SA rating on Friday.The agency said on Monday night that the timing and scope of the cabinet reshuffle raised questions over the signals it sent "regarding the prospects for ongoing reforms, and the fragile recovery i the country's economic and fiscal position". Given the negative impact on fragile domestic and external investor confidence, the change of leadership could have immediate implications for growth and public debt.

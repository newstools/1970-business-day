The South African bond market was slightly firmer on Monday before midday as the market focused on the US Federal Reserve s thinking regarding interest rates.Markets were preparing for a host of speeches from Fed officials this week, which were likely to signal what the Fed s June interest-rate decision would be.Last week, the Fed left interest rates unchanged and the nonfarm jobs data surpassed expectations, increasing the probability of an interest-rate increase.Rand Merchant Bank analyst Michelle Wohlberg said the search for yields is expected to continue, with markets trading with a risk-on bias, and the French elections no longer a market event.The bid on the benchmark R186 bond was at 8.72% from Friday s 8.73%, and 7.56% from 7.565% on the R207.

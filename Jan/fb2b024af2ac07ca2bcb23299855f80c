That the relationship between the government and labour and business is not as cosy as it was a year ago was apparent at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Africa in Durban.&quot;Business was admittedly lacking in presence,&quot; said Investment Solutions chief economist Lesiba Mothata, who attended the summit.&quot;One has not seen the [same interaction between] &#8230; labour and business with the government that we saw 12 months ago. The relationship is not the same as before,&quot; he said.But Business Leadership SA deputy chairman Bonang Mohale, who has been vocal about the Cabinet reshuffle, said business had been present. &quot;Business can&#8217;t boycott pushing SA &#8230; we have an obligation.&quot;However, there was a lot of concern about SA, he said.&quot;At the time that we had a team promoting investment, they were called back, that was an own goal.&quot; Business would &quot;roll up our sleeves and do the work&quot;, he said.

Vodacom executive Vuyani Jarana has been appointed South African Airways (SAA) CEO.He will commence his duties after his current employer has officially released him.Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba congratulated Jarana, saying: Given that Mr Jarana has turned around a loss-making subsidiary of the Vodacom Group, Vodacom Business Africa, into a profitable and growth business, we believe he will be key in turning around SAA. The Treasury said in a statement on Thursday that Jarana had, among other successes, transformed and positioned Vodacom Business as a growth engine of the Vodacom group, growing its contribution to group service revenues from under 10% to 25% over three years.He had also transformed Stortech, a 51% subsidiary of Vodacom, from a declining business to a new growth company, changing its shareholding structure and developing a new strategy that responded to the changes in the market. He built a solid and transformed organisation with emphases on both top-line business growth as well as margin expansion, the Treasury said.It also stated that Gigaba had undertaken to meet the deadlines set out in his 14-point action plan released in July. The Treasury was tasked with implementing three key issues by the deadline of July 31 namely the appointment of a CEO for SAA; implementing the preferential procurement regulations, which took effect on April 1; and engaging other government departments on the private-sector participation framework.

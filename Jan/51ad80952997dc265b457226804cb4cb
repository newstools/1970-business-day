Barclays Africa s decision to grant R191m in restricted-share awards to retain 74 key employees during the Barclays plc sell-down is standard action for a firm undergoing considerable change, says the Institute of Directors in Southern Africa."It is not unusual to offer share-based incentives to senior executives as a retention mechanism in times of significant change," said Ray Harraway, chairman of the body s remuneration committee forum.Incentive payments were commonly used to retain skills during large transactions, which created uncertainty for a business, said a reward expert.Many of these individuals would be doing additional work to disentangle and redeploy various systems across the bank, warranting extra pay, he said.Barclays Africa had granted share awards in the form of cash, which would be converted to equity, it said in its 2016 integrated report.The awards, which were granted in October 2016, are tied to performance targets to be met over the two years ending September 2018.After the Barclays plc divestment announcement, Barclays Africa s remuneration committee considered various options to strengthen its ability to retain skills "critical at this time, while also ensuring that we comply with local and international regulations", Barclays Africa said."It is also in the interest of investors and regulators that we retain critical leadership talent during this period."In approving the Barclays plc sell-down of its then 62.3% stake in Barclays Africa, it is likely that the Reserve Bank would have sought certainty that Barclays Africa had taken steps to ensure leadership stability."I understand that the executives do not currently have unvested long-term incentives that would normally serve as a retention mechanism. So such an award appears appropriate to reduce the perceived flight risk," said Harraway.The R191m split across 74 employees could be seen in the context of the about R200m that Old Mutual plc had proposed to pay CEO Bruce Hemphill as part of that group s managed separation process.Barclays plc s sell-down has weighed on Barclays Africa s share price, which has lagged the JSE s banks index by a margin of 13.54% since the transaction was announced on March 1 2016.Harry Botha, an analyst at Avior Capital Markets, previously told Business Day investors were concerned the sell-down would occur in the open market, creating a stock overhang and reducing the value of the share.

President Jacob Zuma has decided not to suspend National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams.This was after Abrahams dramatically announced last year that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan would face charges related to his tenure at the South African Revenue Service (SARS), and then dropped the charges two weeks later.In October, Zuma had asked Abrahams, North Gauteng director of public prosecutions advocate Sibongile Mzinyathi, and the acting head of the priority crimes litigation unit, Dr Torie Pretorius &mdash; who were also party to the decision &mdash; to provide reasons for their not being suspended.The Helen Suzman Foundation and Freedom Under Law also applied for a court order to compel President Jacob Zuma to exercise his power to suspend Abrahams over the botched fraud charges.However, in a statement on Friday, the Presidency said: &ldquo;Having considered the submissions received from the three prosecutors and concerns raised by the Helen Suzman Foundation and Freedom Under Law regarding their conduct in as far as it relates to the decision to charge and review the charges against Minister Pravin Gordhan, Mr Ivan Pillay and Mr Oupa Magushula, the President could not find substantiation for the claim that advocate Abrahams, advocate Mzinyathi and Dr Pretorius&rsquo;s conducts were actuated by ulterior motive, or any other improper motive which would give rise to a charge of misconduct, or that they are no longer fit and proper to hold office.&rdquo;It was the President&rsquo;s &ldquo;well-considered view&rdquo; that there was no prima facie evidence showing that the conduct of the trio constituted misconduct or a lack of fitness to hold office.

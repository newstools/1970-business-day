The JSE closed weaker on Thursday, its first day of losses in five sessions, as upbeat mining production data failed to lift resources in a stronger rand environment.Platinum and gold shares climbed on higher metal prices as sentiment towards commodities remained fragile, despite higher oil prices. At the JSE s close, Brent crude had gained 1.30% to $50.90 a barrel.Platinum added 0.54% to $915.16 an ounce and gold 0.53% to $1,225.27.Mining and general retailer stocks were lower with banks and financials also losing ground. This was despite a stronger rand which firmed to an intra-day best level of R13.31 to the dollar before weakening again to R13.38 in late afternoon trade.This capped gains in industrials and rand hedges, with market heavyweight Naspers also taking a breather in choppy trade after recording strong gains earlier in the week.Total output in the mining sector in March jumped by an annual 15.5%, stronger than the consensus forecast of 4.3% and following 4.1% growth in February. Iron ore, platinum group metals and coal production numbers were all up.Higher mining production boosted the possibility of GDP growth of about 1% in the first quarter, despite weak retail sales growth and subdued growth in the manufacturing sector.Manufacturing production in March increased an annual 0.3%, but declined a monthly 0.6%, while the quarterly figure dropped 0.9%."The surprisingly strong performance of the mining and manufacturing sectors suggest that the economy probably avoided re-entering recession in the first quarter," said Capital Economics analyst John Ashbourne, adding that much depends on the March retail sales figures, due for release next week.

South African Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan has unexpectedly pulled out of the race for a place on the Fifa council, creating a crisis for the Confederation of African Football (Caf).Jordaan&sbquo; who has long held ambitions of sitting on the powerful Fifa cabinet&sbquo; pulled out at the same time as his main rival&sbquo; leaving too few candidates to fill Africa&rsquo;s places on the council.This means another election will be needed in the coming months.South Sudan&rsquo;s Chabur Goc Alei, the only man standing between Jordaan and a place on the council, has also withdrawn.The Safa president was therefore unopposed in his category and assured of a seat in the inner sanctum of world football&rsquo;s governing body.But Jordaan also pulled out of the race on Monday&sbquo; in a letter sent at 3pm&sbquo; just hours before Fifa published the results of its integrity checks on the candidates.Attempts to contact him for comment on Tuesday were unsuccessful as he was scheduled to travel back to SA from Zambia.Jordaan&rsquo;s withdrawal came just days after success in his month-long legal fight with Caf to remove a potentially powerful opponent from his category in elections.Jordaan was originally one of four men fighting for two places in the open category of the African elections for the Fifa council&sbquo; to be held in Addis Ababa next week.Jordaan argued successfully with Caf over the past month that Egypt&rsquo;s Hany Abo Rida could not compete in the open category as he had originally entered in the category reserved for candidates from Arabic-speaking countries.Candidates who put themselves forward for election must state which category they want to contest and may not then change.With Abu Rida out of the way&sbquo; Jordaan was left to take on Almamy Kabele Camara of Guinea and Alei. The top two in the voting would go to the Fifa council.Now there is just a single candidate and Caf will have to organise a new election for the second place. This will probably happen in May, before the Fifa congress in Bahrain.Fifa announced late on Monday night that 10 candidates had passed the integrity checks, but because Jordaan had already withdrawn, no comment on his status was issued.Africa has seven Fifa council places and next week&rsquo;s Caf congress in the Ethiopian capital will determine the winners in various categories.One place is reserved for the winner of the Caf presidential election and another for a woman candidate. That will go to Lydia Nsekera of Burundi&sbquo; who is the only woman in the field.The other five places are divided into language groups and an open category.There is one place and two candidates in the Arabic language category&sbquo; one place and two candidates in the Anglophone category, and two Francophone candidates vying for one place.TMG Digital

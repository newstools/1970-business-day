Edinburgh The decision by British Prime Minister Theresa May to call an early election on June 8 gives Scotland a chance to reinforce its democratic mandate to hold an independence referendum, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggested on Tuesday.May unexpectedly announced the early election in a statement outside her Downing Street office in London, earlier on Tuesday."In terms of Scotland, this move is a huge political miscalculation by the prime minister," Sturgeon, whose Scottish National Party (SNP) is seeking a referendum on independence from the UK, said in a statement."It will once again give people the opportunity to reject the [Conservative government s] narrow, divisive agenda, as well as reinforcing the democratic mandate, which already exists for giving the people of Scotland a choice on their future," she said.Scots voted by a 10-point margin in 2014 to stay part of the UK, but Sturgeon s party wants a new referendum within the next two years, arguing that the UK s vote to leave the EU changes circumstances fundamentally.Scotland voted to stay in the EU in last June s referendum, but the UK as a whole voted for Brexit.Reuters

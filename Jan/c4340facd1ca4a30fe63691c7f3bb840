The Tshwane metro police department did not approve the anti-xenophobia march in Pretoria on Thursday&sbquo; saying the organisers failed to meet the necessary requirements. Spokesperson Isaac Mahamba said the organisers&sbquo; the Coalition of Civics against Xenophobia&sbquo; had failed to provide the department with a letter from the person to whom they would hand the memorandum.He said on this basis&sbquo; the application for the march was declined.&ldquo;For a march to be approved&sbquo; the organisers must obtain a letter from the person who will accept their memorandum stating when ... that person will be available to accept the memorandum. They did not have that so we could not approve the march&sbquo;&rdquo; he said.Mahamba said this was why there was no one to receive their memorandum at the Union Building&sbquo; the very situation the bylaws aimed to prevent in the first place.He said the organisers ended up &ldquo;handing over the memorandum and reading it to themselves. They have now dispersed.&rdquo;Organisers earlier expressed dismay at the Presidency&rsquo;s refusal to accept their memorandum&sbquo; branding the government and President Jacob Zuma xenophobic.Themba Ncalo&sbquo; chairman of the Coalition of Civics Against Xenophobia&sbquo; said they were told Zuma&rsquo;s office would not accept their memorandum, but were given no explanation.Case lostMahamba said after the police had declined the application for the march&sbquo; the organisers went to court to challenge the decision but they lost the case.&ldquo;They still gathered so we opened a case of illegal gathering. We then kept watch to ensure people who were not participating in the march were not affected. This was to ensure that should anything happen&sbquo; the organisers would have been held responsible&sbquo;&rdquo; he said.The group of about 200 people first gathered at Burghers Park in the CBD before heading to the Union Buildings in Arcadia to hand over their memorandum.In their memorandum, read on the Union Buildings lawns&sbquo; the coalition demands an investigation into and prosecution of Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba for inciting violence in his anti-immigrant utterances.They also decried what they said was the government&rsquo;s poor response to xenophobic violence.The coalition&sbquo; made up of both locals and immigrants under the auspices of Lawyers for Human Rights&sbquo; also wants measures to be put in place to ensure the government takes seriously the investigations of attacks on foreign nationals and their businesses, as well as a campaign to tackle corruption within the police.According to the coalition&sbquo; issues of unemployment&sbquo; housing and crime are central to the xenophobic sentiment taking hold, as locals blame immigrants for their unfortunate economic and social situations.These issues need to be addressed urgently to prevent further flare ups, the coalition says.It wants the government to convene an urgent meeting with President Jacob Zuma&sbquo; which would involve all relevant government role players&sbquo; including Tshwane and Johannesburg authorities&sbquo; within 14 days.TMG Digital/The Times&nbsp;

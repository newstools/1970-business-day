Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says replacing one individual does not warrant a downgrade.Gigaba was speaking on Monday, amid fears that SA could receive a ratings downgrade this week.S&amp;P Global Ratings was expected to pronounce on its credit rating of SA on Monday, following an emergency meeting at the weekend.Moody s was scheduled to release its sovereign rating review of SA on Friday, while Fitch, which rates SA on the edge of junk at BBB-, does not forewarn when it will release its reviews."I m not the president. I didn t get the intelligence report I don t ask questions, I simply comply with the instructions given to me. There s so much going on in our country that changing a certain individual won t cause a credit downgrade," he said."We have it in us as a nation to manage any changes that may have taken place."Addressing questions around his capacity to serve as finance minister, Gigaba said: "I hold a masters degree. I m quite educated. I don t think anyone should doubt my capacity to adapt and adjust to a new portfolio."Gigaba said SA had solid institutions that were sufficiently able to deal with any changes in the political leadership. He said that "life will go on after the shock, the anxiety"."The uncertainties didn t start last week, it s been going on for sometime."Gigaba and deputy finance minister Sfiso Buthelezi said they met with rating agencies on Friday before they were sworn in. Buthelezi said: "It was consistent with that has always been communicated to them by our predecessors.""There is no way we can guarantee what direction the rating agencies are going to take.&nbsp; We can't do it."

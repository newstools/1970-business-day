Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has a definitive message for warring acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and Independent Police Investigative Directorate head Robert McBride: Stop your nonsense and get on with your jobs.Speaking at the announcement of the appointment of new acting Hawks head Lt-Gen Yolisa Matakata in Pretoria on Thursday Mbalula said he was tired of the wars between the two. He replaced former Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza with Matakata after the Pretoria High Court ruled on Wednesday that last month s high court ruling that Ntlemeza s appointment be reviewed be upheld.Speaking on the sidelines of a media conference announcing Matakata s appointment Mbalula said the fight between Phahlane and McBride was affecting the public s perception of law enforcement in the country. "This needs to stop. You both have jobs to do and you need to get on and do your jobs," he said.He said he would be addressing the confrontation between the two and the perception of political interference in the directorate s work. "I have had an initial meeting with McBride and will be sitting down with him again. I have had meetings with Phahlane and will be speaking to him again ... I will assure McBride and the nation that he will have protection from me to ensure that the directorate can do its job."He also said the unnecessary tensions between the directorate and police must stop: "It is as though [those] people are fighting over jilted love when the fundamental thing should be to fight for the protection of society."Just as the Civilian Secretariat of Police provided a "check" over him so too did the directorate provide "checks and balances" over the police, he said, adding that "this is not going to change. Phahlane must understand this and I have told him as much".McBride and Phahlane have been at war for months following the directorate s investigation into Phahlane who they accuse of receiving financial kickbacks while he headed the police s forensic sciences services. Phahlane has approached the courts to have the directorate stopped from using private forensic investigator Paul O Sullivan in their investigation.TMG Digital

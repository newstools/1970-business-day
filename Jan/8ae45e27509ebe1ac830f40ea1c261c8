Several delegates at the ANC national policy conference are pushing for party leaders to boycott future Cosatu events.This came after the leaders of the labour federation decided a few months ago that President Jacob Zuma should never address any of their events. Zuma was also embarrassed during a May Day rally in the Free State&#8218; where workers prevented him from addressing them.ANC Youth League delegate Thanduxolo Sabelo said it wanted ANC leaders across the country not to attend and address Cosatu events until a solution was found to their decision about Zuma.&quot;Several delegates in commissions have raised it and it has received mixed reaction. If we don&#8217;t win in commission&#8218; we will take it to plenary&#8218;&quot; he said.In one commission, 11 delegates turned down the proposal&#8218; which was raised by a KwaZulu-Natal delegate who was supported by delegates from the North West&#8218; Free State and the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association. But the boycott proposal was defeated by provinces such as the Western Cape&#8218; Gauteng and the Eastern Cape&#8218; who argued that KwaZulu-Natal&#8217;s proposal was not a policy issue and should not be entertained by the conference. &quot;The argument against them was that the matter is purely political and should be left to the NEC (national executive committee) to deal with&#8218; so we&#8217;re not going to make that proposal to plenary&#8218;&quot; said one delegate, who is not authorised to speak to the media and therefore asked not to be named.Among those who spoke against KwaZulu-Natal were ANC MPs Lerumo Kalako and Mondli Gungubele&#8218; Eastern Cape rural development and agrarian reform MEC Mlibo Qoboshiyane as well Telecommunications Minister Siyabonga Cwele.Other issues that were raised sharply included a timeframe for the implementation of free education, and white monopoly capital.Commissions were expected to report back in the plenary session on Tuesday.

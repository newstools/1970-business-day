The 300m record the Wayde van Niekerk broke on Wednesday night is not an official record &#8212; but that takes nothing away from his achievement.The 300m is a rarely run distance, and not recognised as a formal distance for the purposes of International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) record-keeping.But in setting a new world mark for the distance, Van Niekerk not only broke a record that had stood for 17 years, he also achieved a goal Usain Bolt once set for himself and failed to reach.Van Niekerk, running in the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava, Czech Republic, on Wednesday, went four-hundredths of a second under the 30.85sec record set by Michael Johnson in Pretoria in March 2000.Bolt had set his sights on the record in May 2010 &#8212; also at Golden Spike in Ostrava &#8212; but missed it by 0.12 seconds.The 300m is considered a &quot;training distance&quot;, to improve stamina for 200m runners, or speed for 400m runners.Van Niekerk told AFP before the race: &quot;It&#8217;s not really an official event, so I&#8217;m going to go out there and be ridiculous tomorrow, I&#8217;ve got nothing to lose. It&#8217;s the only 300m of the year.&#8230; I&#8217;ll try and give you a show.&quot;

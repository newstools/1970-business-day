Packaging and paper group Mondi has confirmed that the European Commission is conducting an inspection at its Vienna office."Mondi understands the investigation is focused on kraft paper and industrial bags," the group said, and that it was co-operating with the investigation."Mondi is committed to complying with all applicable competition laws and is not aware of any wrongdoing or contravention of the relevant legislation," the group said.The European Commission announced about a year ago that its antitrust officials were performing unannounced inspections of the premises of several companies in the kraft paper and industrial sack segment.It said at the time it was concerned that the companies in question might have violated article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which prohibits anticompetitive practices such as price fixing and customer allocation.

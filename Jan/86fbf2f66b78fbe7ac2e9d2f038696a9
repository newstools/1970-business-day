The JSE closed firmer on Monday as the market started the second half of the year on a positive note following a poor June, in which the market recorded its biggest one-month loss in more than 18 months.Resources led the market on a weaker currency and a rebound in global commodity prices, despite a weaker performance from platinum on the day, falling 1.76% to $909.84 an ounce.The iron ore price has rebounded about 20% from its recent low, thanks to firmer data on the Chinese economy, including steel production.Platinum and gold shares ended the day lower, with the spot price of gold shedding 1.42% to $1,223.17 an ounce on the stronger dollar.Apart from resources, general retailers and banks also gained, on renewed hopes of an interest-rate cut later in the year. Industrials were firmer as selected rand hedges performed on the weaker currency.Stanlib retail investment director Paul Hansen said Stanlib economist Kevin Lings had changed his view on interest rates and now expected a cut in rates by the end of 2017.Hansen said a cut in interest rates had historically been very positive for industrial shares on the JSE, particularly companies doing most of their business in SA."So, all in all, this looks like a good time to be accumulating JSE shares, not lightening," Hansen said.The all share hit a record high of 55,188 points in April 2015 but at the end of last week, it was back at levels last seen in June 2014, after a 3.5% decline in June.The all share lost 4.06% in November 2015 as banking shares pulled back on negative emerging-market sentiment, just before former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene was fired in December."In other words, over a three-year period, dividends have been the only source of return from local equities," analysts at Old Mutual Multi-Managers said.The Old Mutual analysts said JSE returns had been disappointing for investors. Local equities have given below-inflation returns over the past year, while global equities have not contributed in rand terms.Selected local shares have dropped sharply in 2017. ArcelorMittal lost 31% in June and Sun International 15%. Lonmin fell 12.3% in June and 33% in May.

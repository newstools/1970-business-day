Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba has axed his member of the mayoral committee&nbsp;for economic development, Sharon Peetz, for suspected misconduct.In a late night statement Mashaba said Peetz was removed with the agreement of the DA s federal executive. Her removal comes months after the allegation was first made about an official trip to Spain.Peetz was cleared earlier this year after an allegation was made that she had acted irregularly in arranging to take a family member on an official trip to Spain.A forensic investigation was conducted and it was determined that the city did not pay for the cost.&nbsp; Recent evidence has been brought to our attention that the proof of payment, between Peetz and the travel agent, which the councillor had provided to my office as proof that she had paid the travel agent, was allegedly falsified," Mashaba said in the statement.&nbsp;He said a further forensic investigation has been undertaken into the proof of payment and that the money concerned is still allegedly owed to the travel agent. Mashaba said the city did not incur any losses.&nbsp; Through her actions, it is my belief that Cllr Peetz has misled myself, the council and the residents of Johannesburg, Mashaba said.MMC Dr Mpho Phalatse will act in the position.

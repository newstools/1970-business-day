London &mdash; Bitcoin jumped to a new high on Friday, a day after soaring past the price of an ounce of gold for the first time. One unit of the virtual currency was trading above $1,292.71 at 7.30am in New York, compared with $1,226.89 for an ounce of gold. The metal has had a terrible week, declining for the fourth time in five days.The latest surge in bitcoin&rsquo;s value has been attributed to tighter currency restrictions in countries such as China, India and Venezuela, as well as speculation about prospects under the Trump administration.China&rsquo;s three biggest bitcoin exchanges suspended withdrawals last month after pressure from the People&rsquo;s Bank of China, which was concerned that people were using bitcoin to move money out of the country, side-stepping official efforts to shore up the yuan.Investors may also be betting on a more relaxed regulatory environment under US President Donald Trump. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to rule on a proposal for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the digital currency by March 11. "Some people may be front-running what they see as the ETF demand down the road," said John Butler, head of wealth services for Goldmoney, in an interview.Bitcoin still has a lot to prove, he said: "We&rsquo;re a long way from bitcoin establishing its properties as anything that could be considered to be a reasonably stable store of value. The fact that it&rsquo;s passing through gold is just arbitrary."In January, the volatile crypto-currency passed its 2013 peak of $1,137. After the previous peak, it fell 53% in less than a month. Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch noted "the small size of the [bitcoin] market" and "low level of distribution, the lack of general understanding of the concept, the short history of bitcoin, its extreme price volatility and the high proportion of speculators".Bloomberg

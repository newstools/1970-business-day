The ANC&rsquo;s top six have approved the removal of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, ANN7 television reported on Tuesday, citing sources.ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, one of the ANC&rsquo;s top six, told Reuters he could not comment on the report.ANN7 also reported that Brian Molefe, former head of state utility Eskom, and former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, were not in the running to replace Gordhan.There were rumours at lunchtime on Tuesday that Gordhan would resign, but&nbsp;Treasury spokeswoman Yolisa Tyantsi said she had no knowledge of&nbsp;such a plan.President Jacob Zuma on Monday abruptly ordered Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, to return from a&nbsp;UK investor roadshow, a move that spooked&nbsp;investors and sparked speculation that a long-expected Cabinet reshuffle was imminent.The rand was about 2% weaker at lunchtime on Tuesday, in volatile trade.&ldquo;Were Pravin Gordhan to actually be removed, we think that the rand could fall by another 5% against the dollar,&rdquo; Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said in a note.Molefe was made an MP just over a month ago, after leaving his job as Eskom CE under a cloud&nbsp;late last year. His move to Parliament led to speculation that he was being prepared to replace Gordhan.Gordhan&rsquo;s tenure as finance minister &mdash; his second stint in the job &mdash; was under threat since he took over from &ldquo;weekend special&rdquo; Des van Rooyen in December 2015.The acrimony between him and President Jacob Zuma has played out on several fronts.He was subjected to investigation by the Hawks early last year over an alleged &ldquo;rogue unit&rdquo; at SARS, and in October faced the threat of arrest on fraud charges. Those charges were dropped.In the matter of the Guptas and the banks, Gordhan sought a declaratory order confirming that he was not empowered to intervene in the banks&rsquo; decision to close the accounts of Gupta companies.A High Court hearing of that matter is under way at the moment, in which Zuma&rsquo;s attempt to intervene as an &ldquo;interested party&rdquo; was turned down.He was also at the forefront of SA&rsquo;s attempts to stave off several credit rating downgrades in the past year-and-a-half, so his recall from the UK roadshow and the threat of his removal spooked investors.Gordhan has also bumped heads with South African Revenue Service commissioner Tom Moyane. Last week Jonas gave the tax ombud the go-ahead to probe SARS's systems over complaints about late VAT refunds.Reuters, with staff writer

The Treasury s director-general Lungisa Fuzile confirmed reports that he had resigned, on Wednesday.Fuzile s contract was due to end in May 2018; however, last week he asked former finance minister Pravin Gordhan for a redetermination of his contract, with the exit date of May 15 2017.His departure raises questions as to whether more of the Treasury s senior officials might walk out, with reports of new Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba bringing in more than 16 of the ministerial staff and advisers who served him in his previous post at the Department of Home Affairs.The Treasury said in a statement: "He has been indicating his desire to leave the Treasury for some time."In the past few days, Fuzile has been focusing on ensuring a smooth hand over to minister Malusi Gigaba. Whilst Fuzile has indicated his flexibility to stay on for reasonable amount of time if needed, he and the minister are in discussions on how to ensure that a smooth transition and the institutional strength of National Treasury is sustained and reinforced."Fuzile said his departure and the departure of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas, should not necessarily lead to a change of course, as the mandate of the Treasury was reinforced by the Constitution and other legislation.He added that Treasury officials were competent, highly skilled professionals who were very conscious of their higher duty.

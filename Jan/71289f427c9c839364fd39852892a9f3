The reintegration of the City of Johannesburg&rsquo;s 13 entities has been intensified so as to improve service delivery in the metro, city manager Ndivhoniswani Lukhwareni says. Lukhwareni delivered his strategic overview of Johannesburg&rsquo;s 2015-16 performance to investors at the Hyatt Hotel&sbquo; Rosebank&sbquo; on Friday.The entities include Pikitup&sbquo; City Power and Joburg Water. A task-team was established to look at the feasibility of their reintegration and a decision was taken by the Johannesburg city council earlier this year."We have opted to absorb them so that services will now be run by departments. The assurance we have is that&sbquo; except for the board members&sbquo; there will be not much change in positions&sbquo;" said Lukhwareni. "The technical work still remains and the people doing that work will still [retain] their jobs."Earlier this year&sbquo; Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba said he was moving to bring the city&rsquo;s agencies under the metro&rsquo;s authority in an apparent about-turn on a promise made in the run-up to the 2016 local government elections.He took aim at the boards of entities belonging to the city&sbquo; pledging to make savings of at least R18m from the salaries of non-executive board members alone. However&sbquo; he said the proposed changes were aimed at improving accountability.Mashaba also gave the assurance that no jobs would be lost in the proposed restructuring&sbquo; saying the city would be "extremely sensitive to the issue of employment".The integration would take about 18 months&sbquo; according to the mayor.TMG Digital

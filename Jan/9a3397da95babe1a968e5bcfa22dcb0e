President Jacob Zuma on Thursday said government's quest to create an inclusive economy was far from over.He was speaking to the community of Manguzi in the Umkhayakude District Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal.Zuma said that while life under democracy was better than it was under apartheid, continued inequality in economic participation and racism undermined much of the gains made since the advent of democracy 23 years ago.Zuma said that radical economic transformation, including land reform, had become a foremost priority for the ANC and the government."We will use all instruments necessary to effect land restitution and reform and address land hunger. The land question will feature prominently at the June conference of the ANC," said Zuma.He made mention of Sodwana Bay guest lodge owner Andre Slade, who shocked the nation when he openly refused to host black guests at his lodge, saying that the debacle was a by-product of an unequal economy and untransformed sectors.He said "only" 10% of the top 100 companies on the JSE are principally black owned. He also down talked the notion that black people that are given land would not be able to make the land economically productive."It is not true that we don t know how to work the land. We had been doing it for years. There is no one who can teach us anything we don t know about making the land produce. And what the land produces must benefit its people," he said.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC KwaZulu-Natal chairman Sihle Zikalala and Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa were also in attendance.

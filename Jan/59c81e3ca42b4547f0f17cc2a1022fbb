Opposition parties call for a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma is not about removing the ANC, the parties said on Monday."The ANC was voted into government by the majority, through the democratic project, which we respect," DA leader Mmusi Maimane said on behalf of the parties."In the short term, we are working to remove Jacob Zuma, and elect someone from the ranks of the National Assembly who is committed to SA, the people and the Constitution."The DA, EFF, United Democratic Movement (UDM), Congress of the People (COPE), Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) met in Johannesburg on Monday.All parties were behind the motion of no confidence and the call for National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to convene a special sitting so the motion can be debated and voted on.Mbete said on Sunday that she had cut short an overseas trip so she could urgently deal with the request.The EFF and DA put in a request to Mbete last week following the late-night Cabinet reshuffle. The UDM put in its own request on Monday.The parties said they were expecting an urgent answer from Mbete.On Monday Mbete was at Luthuli House attending an ANC national working committee meeting."Given the crisis engulfing our society, we are confident that MPs will stay true to the Constitution and their oath of office," Maimane said.The opposition parties are hoping ANC MPs, who were against the removal of finance minister Pravin Gordhan, will vote to remove Zuma.Opposition parties are also organising a day of action that would include a march to the Union Buildings. No date has been given for this.The DA will be submitting papers for a review application to test the legal rationality of Zuma s decision to reshuffle.The EFF, UDM and COPE last week filed papers with the Constitutional Court asking that it order Mbete to hold Zuma accountable.

As thousands of people around the world paid tribute to late apartheid stalwart Ahmed Kathrada, the KwaZulu-Natal establishment was not left behindThe ANC in KwaZulu-Natal said Kathrada was one of the selfless leaders who went through great personal pain and sacrifices to ensure that SA was liberated from the yoke of apartheid.Sihle Zikalala, ANC KwaZulu-Natal chairperson and KwaZulu-Natal MEC for economic development, tourism and environmental affairs, said Kathrada would be remembered by many generations to come for his role in the emancipation of oppressed people of this country."We are saying rest in peace to this stalwart. Isithwalandwe. You made an indelible mark in the struggle for freedom," Zikalala said.Prof Pitika Ntuli said also paid tribute to the late ANC veteran. "Kathrada lived, sacrificed, suffered and died for his beliefs and betrayed by those who only seek personal profit at all costs!"The National Freedom Party (NFP) said it was saddened by such a loss, and the entire nation would remember Kathrada for his contribution to the struggle for freedom in SA.NFP spokesperson Sabelo Sigudu said: "Mr Ahmed Kathrada paved a way for us the generation today and opened doors for us to access all opportunities, which they fought for in Robben Island with likes of Mr Walter Sisulu, Mr Nelson Mandela and Mr Govan Mbeki to mention few. He fought for justice, equality [and a] nonracial and nonsexist society."It is so inspiring that he never fought for positions or power: during his term as an MP when President Mandela had appointed him as minister of correctional services, he become honest to himself and told them that he was not interested. As the president of the current government, Mr Jacob Zuma, plans his Cabinet reshuffling, we advise him to learn from the likes of Ahmed Kathrada and appoint people who have the country s interest at heart," Sigudu said.

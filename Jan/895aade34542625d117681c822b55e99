Eskom has interrupted power to eight municipalities in three provinces since January this year.This was done as a last resort to ensure that the indebted councils settled their bills, Eskom told Parliament&rsquo;s standing committee on public accounts on Wednesday.The utility has been negotiating back and forth with scores of municipalities around the country that owe it money for power.The matter escalated when councils, who are among the top defaulters, continuously reneged on their commitments to pay, forcing Eskom to schedule power interruptions to at least 26 towns including Ventersdorp, Richmond, Witbank, Ermelo and Bloemhof.The total amount owed to Eskom by municipalities is R9.9bn.Eskom interim CEO Matshela Koko told the standing committee that the utility experienced problems with getting two municipalities from Mpumalanga to honour the amounts stipulated in their payment agreements with Eskom."Msukaligwa paid a total of R28m on overdue debt while Eskom expected R50m on the same. Emalahleni only paid R6m on overdue payment while Eskom expected about R277m on the same," said Koko.He also said the Eskom-supplied area that owed the utility the most money for power was Soweto. Eskom had installed 10,071 smart meters with another 10,404 meters being converted to prepaid in Soweto.The township owes Eskom more than R12bn including interest. The debt owed by Soweto&rsquo;s households is not considered debt incurred by the City of Joburg, as the township&rsquo;s electricity comes from Eskom directly, while the metro&rsquo;s power entity, City Power, serves the city&rsquo;s various suburbs.Koko said it was a mistake for the power utility to allow the overall municipal debt to escalate to the point it eventually reached.The utility had made concessions for councils in the matter including having councils that commit to repayment agreements enjoying a reduction on the interest rate on their debt from prime plus 5% to prime plus 2%.The utility said it would also change its payment period for municipal bulk infrastructure from 15 days to 30 days.

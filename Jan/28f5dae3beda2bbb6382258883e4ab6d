Seoul &#8212; North Korea on Sunday put down the latest UN sanctions as &quot;mean&quot; and vowed to press ahead with its missile and nuclear weapons programmes.The UN Security Council on Friday unanimously adopted a US-drafted resolution imposing new targeted sanctions on a handful of North Korean officials and entities, in response to a 2017 series of ballistic missile tests that are banned under UN resolutions.The resolution put North Korea&#8217;s suspected spy chief, 13 other Pyongyang officials and four entities on a sanctions blacklist, hitting them with a global travel ban and an assets freeze.The North&#8217;s foreign ministry &quot;condemns and outrightly rejects the sanctions racket put forth by the US and the UN Security Council to prevent the strengthening of our nuclear deterrence&quot;, a ministry spokesman said.&quot;[Washington] talked about the possibility of dialogue but it is nonsense to mention dialogue while laying out unfair preconditions and applying maximum pressure,&quot; the spokesman said.The latest resolution was said to have been put together by the US and China in the &quot;back room&quot;, the statement said.

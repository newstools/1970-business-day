Mitsubishi has issued a recall in SA of several models that use Takata airbags.The models affected are the Triton bakkie, the Lancer sedan and the Pajero SUV.Mitusbishi says on its website that the inspection and replacement will take about an hour.It says all Triton models built between 2007 and 2016; all Lancer 1.6 litre "and EVO derivatives" sold between 2003 and 2007; and all Pajero models built between 2007 and 2016 are affected.The Mitsubishi website did not say other models were affected.The fault with Takata&rsquo;s airbags &mdash; a defect that causes them sometimes to explode when they are deployed &mdash; has led to the biggest safety recall in the global automotive industry&rsquo;s history.It has also bankrupted Takata.In January the company, which hid the defect for 15 years, agreed to a $1bn settlement in a criminal investigation.

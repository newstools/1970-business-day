SA's bulk export volumes surged by 18.6% year on year in February to 14.9-million tonnes after falling by 6.5% year on year in January to 13.5-million tonnes, following a 2.8% drop in 2016 to 163.3-million tonnes, data from the Transnet National Ports Authority showed on Wednesday.Policy uncertainty and logistics constraints meant that SA lost out on the 2003 to 2008 commodity price boom with annual bulk exports increasing by a mere 2.8-million tonnes between those years. Since then there has been a marked turnaround due to better policy co-ordination between mining companies and state-owned Transnet, with volumes improving by 45% or 52.3-million tonnes between 2008 and 2015. Low commodity prices in 2016, however, constrained supply.A jump in commodity prices since US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s election in November may result in a boost in bulk exports in 2017, as bulk exports grew by 9.5% year on year in November, after a 0.7%year-on-year drop in October. In December, bulk export volumes increased by 7.4% year on year. In the first two months of 2017, bulk export volumes have improved by 5.2% year on year.Bulk exports out of Richards Bay, which are mostly coal, rose by 17.6% year on year to 7.4-million tonnes in February, after falling by 10.8% year on year in January to 7.0-million tonnes and easing by 2.8% in 2016 to 90.4-million tonnes. As Richards Bay Coal Terminal no longer releases operational statistics, economists are finding it more difficult to track economic performance in SA in a timeous manner.Bulk exports out of Saldanha, which are mostly iron ore, jumped by 19.5% year on year in February to 6.3-million tonnes, after dropping by 7.6% year on year in January to 5.3-million tonnes following a 5.6% decline in 2016 to 59.8-million tonnes.The slump in the maize harvest in 2016 did not seem to affect bulk exports out of the other ports, such as Durban, with a 12.6% rise in 2016 to 14.1-million tonnes after slumping by 19.3% in 2015 to 11.6-million tonnes. In January, there was a 46.9% year-on-year surge to 1.1-million tonnes, and this was followed by a 20.2% year-on-year gain in February to 1.1-million tonnes. The Agricultural Business Chamber expects the 79% increase in the maize harvest in 2017 to lead to maize exports of some 3-million tonnes this year.

Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) board chairman Popo Molefe said he was shocked by the dissolution of Prasa&rsquo;s board by Parliament on Wednesday and vowed to have the decision reviewed by the courts.The board was dissolved following the removal of controversial acting CEO Collins Letsoalo. Letsoalo was removed in February after reports revealed he had given himself a 350% salary increase.Molefe said he had not been informed of the board&rsquo;s dissolution by Transport Minister Dipuo Peters&sbquo; and had heard of it through media reports."Prior to the reports the minister had requested the board to submit a report relating to the irregular salary increment of Collins Letsoalo, whom she had seconded to Prasa from the Department of Transport. We had submitted the report as requested. To date&sbquo; we are yet to receive a response from the minister. It therefore comes as a surprise to us that the minister would have taken such a decision without notice to members of the board nor followed due process."I believe that the decision of the minister is reviewable and hereby give notice that I will seek recourse in the courts."Molefe charged that the minister&rsquo;s action "imperils the ongoing investigations into R14bn in irregular expenditure; actions taken by the board in the courts to recoup losses up to R7bn; criminal investigations that involve suspected corruption&sbquo; fraud and money laundering that involves several billions of rand; and the turnaround in Prasa operations."He said the action impugned his reputation and dignity. "I am considering my options in this regard."Molefe said that he had written to the Speaker, Baleke Mbete asking her to institute a parliamentary inquiry into Prasa operations and governance."I hope she grants this request as I intend to account fully to Parliament and the people of SA."Letsoalo was axed after a Sunday Times report detailed how he demanded a 350% salary increase taking his earnings to R5.9m a year and a chauffeur after being seconded to Prasa from the Department of Transport with the goal of fixing the embattled rail entity.A defiant Letsoalo claimed at a press conference the board had confirmed his increase. But the board denied it had authorised the hike and said it took a dim view of the controversy over his pay.MPs have been calling for the board to be removed since Tuesday, after it was hauled over the coals for being "corrupt" and over its handling of Letsoalo s ouster from Prasa.The portfolio committee on transport resolved on Wednesday to establish an inquiry into Prasa s governance issues.Chairwoman Dikeledi Magadzi said the committee had not taken the resolution lightly."After two days of deliberations the committee still did not have a sense of whether Prasa will be saved. It is important that Prasa works if we are to grow the economy and deliver on the mandate to get poor South Africans to work " Magadzi said.Magadzi said there was no sense that the board was in control of anything."It does not seem that there are controls at the entity to ensure good governance in line with legislation. That said the committee is of the view that the entity could still be saved " she said.TMG Digital

South African Airway&rsquo;s (SAA) is now expecting a loss of R4.5bn for the 2016-17 financial year, R1bn more than projected 10 days ago.SAA has also distanced itself from comments made by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan that a new CEO could be finalised by the end of March. Business Day understands that candidate interviews were to continue from Monday, and that a preferred candidate might only be submitted to the Treasury in April.On Monday, the DA said the latest information provided to the standing committee on finance by SAA had noted the R4.5bn loss, and that it would put the "volatility" in financial statements to SAA when it appeared before Parliament on Wednesday.It was "simply inconceivable that SAA losses have increased by a staggering R1bn in a matter of weeks," DA deputy finance spokesperson Alf Lees said.For the 11 months of the 2016-17 financial year to February, SAA said it projected a R4.5bn loss, which it attributed to exchange-rate volatility."It is important to highlight that the budgeted loss did not take into account the expected movement of the exchange rate. This was because of the volatility that it can present to the financials of the company," the group income statement submitted to Parliament read.In a letter to National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete dated March 14, Gordhan had said a new CEO could be agreed on by the end of March, while requesting a delay in submission of SAA s three-year corporate plan.A single-year corporate plan would be submitted by the end of March instead of the three-year plan required by the Public Management Finance Act. This would then be submitted by the end of July. The delay would also allow the new CEO to be appointed and familiarise himself or herself with the issues, the letter read.SAA spokesperson Tlali Tali referred questions on the appointment process to the Treasury, noting that the airline had not been asked to comment on previous reports on the appointment process of the CEO.The Treasury did not immediately comment on Monday.

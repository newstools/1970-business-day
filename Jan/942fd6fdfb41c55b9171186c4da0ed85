In an effort to create a platform for donors to sponsor student fees&#8218; Standard Bank and Feenix Trust launched a crowdfunding initiative in Johannesburg on Tuesday. The trust has been established to retain and manage funds from donors.Jayshree Naidoo&#8218; interim CEO of Feenix&#8218; said only 17% of students in SA who qualify for education funding will actually get it. The trust is intended to address this.&quot;The fees will be paid directly to the university through the trust. Students won&#8217;t be required to pay back the money,&quot; she said. &quot;All degree types for accredited courses at any of the 26 public universities across SA will be accepted. &quot;The donations will cover accommodation&#8218; tuition and textbooks.&quot;Johan De Ru&#8218; manager for business development, education at Standard Bank, said: &quot;Students can create profiles on the Feenix website and upload their fees statement and bio. The trust will then verify them and, once they are live on the site&#8218; donors can choose to donate to them.&quot;Anyone can donate, with a minimum donation being R100. Donors are required to upload their information and will go through verification&#8218; according to the standards of the bank.De Ru said 120 students were already live on the platform, and 604 had registered and were awaiting approval. &quot;Long-distance, and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions will be included later.&quot;&quot;Students will be required to upload their fees statement every year, and the trust does not have any academic requirements. There is no limit to who can apply&#8218;&quot; De Ru said.In 2015&#8218; students across SA embarked on a nationwide protest to call for tuition fees to be scrapped. Said De Ru: &quot;The fees protest was one of the elements that indicated this project is needed to solve some of the problems in the country.&quot;

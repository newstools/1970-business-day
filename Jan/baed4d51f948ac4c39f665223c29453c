The rand remained weaker in late afternoon trade on Tuesday. despite a comment from Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan that he "is still the finance minister".Gordhan arrived at the High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday afternoon where his application for a declaratory order preventing him from intervening in the saga between SA&rsquo;s banks and Gupta-linked companies, was being heard.He declined to answer further questions.Gordhan reportedly visited Luthuli House after his return to SA from the UK after President Jacob Zuma recalled him from an international investor roadshow. Analysts said it was unlikely at this stage that Zuma would fire Gordhan until after the funeral of struggle icon Ahmed Kathrada.TreasuryOne trader John Moni said the rand would remain under pressure while the rumours of indirect intervention from the Gupta family in rand trading continued."According to these, the Guptas were badly cash-strapped and in desperate need of funds heading into the present court battle between Gordhan and all honest tax paying citizens, versus the Guptas and those on their payroll," he said.At 3.40pm the rand was at R12.9171 against the dollar from R12.7616.The rand was at R14.0314 against the euro from R13.8647 and at R16.210 against the pound from R16.0221.The euro was at $1.0862 from $1.0864.Analysts said further weakness in the greenback was halted for the moment following hawkish comments from officials of the US Federal Reserve that further rate increases in the US were still on the cards this year.

The consensus market forecast was for an annual increase of 2%. The mining sector is expected to fare moderately better in 2017 off last year s low base, said Nedbank economist Nicky Weimar: "Stronger global growth and firmer international commodity prices should support higher production and export sales."Retailers brushed off weak retail data released on Wednesday. From December 2016 to February 2017, retail sales fell by a substantial quarterly 1.3%, which was the worst quarterly performance since the global financial market crisis. Stanlib economist Kevin Lings ascribed the robust performance rising more than 3% to the monthly growth of 0.8% in February after declining by a monthly 1.2% in January. "The retail sector has been relatively resilient when compared with other key sectors in the economy, such as mining and manufacturing, because household income growth has consistently exceeded inflation."The Dow Jones was flat at the JSE s close with market focus on financials as JP Morgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo were set to report their quarterly results later on Thursday.Platinum rose 0.17% to $972 an ounce.

On Thursday, President Jacob Zuma said there has been clear progress in basic service delivery in certain municipalities since the end of the apartheid era. He said the post-apartheid government had continued to work hard to achieve radical and meaningful change in the performance of local government, which was not the case in the past."Apartheid geography and centralised spatial planning ensured that the majority of our people were housed and located in marginal areas from the city centres far away from the economic hub and opportunities, as well as from services [and] this perpetuated their exclusion from the economy " said Zuma.He gave municipal representatives up to 15 years to ensure that previously disadvantaged communities benefit from the country s resources. "A municipality s objective must also be to turn the tide against the current spatial patterns of apartheid in the next five to 15 years though better and co-ordinated land-use management ensuring that a new built environment and inclusive spatial landscape emerges across the country," Zuma said."A the centre of a municipality s social transformation activities must be the provision of social protection to the vulnerable in particular women and children the eradication of poverty, and the building of social cohesion and social solidarity."He noted that the progress achieved between 2002 and 2015 included an increase from 77% to 85% in the number of households with access to electricity, and that the country had also achieved an increase from 85% to more than 90% of households with access to piped water.Households obtaining sanitation devices went from 62% to 80%. More than 78% of households lived in formal dwellings, however, 14% of people lived in informal dwellings and 7% lived in traditional ones.The president said 14% of South African households were living in Reconstruction and Development Programme housing or state-subsidised dwellings. Furthermore 18% of female-headed households received a government housing subsidy while 12% of male-headed households received one.TMG Digital

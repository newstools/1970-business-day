AfriForum on Thursday laid criminal charges against officials&sbquo; contractors and suppliers involved in a low-cost housing scandal whose beneficiaries included Hlaudi Motsoeneng.Sunday Times reported in January that Motsoeneng and Nozuko Mbalula, the wife of Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula &mdash; as trustees of two trusts &mdash; benefited from a R1.3bn spending spree by the Free State government meant to provide houses for the poor that were never built.The civil rights organisation laid a criminal complaint at the Parkweg Police Station in Bloemfontein against officials&sbquo; contractors and suppliers of the Free State human settlements department."This step follows after it came to light in a national newspaper in January 2017 that R400m&sbquo; which was earmarked for low-cost housing&sbquo; was unlawfully paid out to contractors in the 2010-11 financial year," said Afriforum. "Two of the beneficiary contractors and suppliers are, amongst others, Hlaudi Motsoeneng and Nozuko Mbalula&sbquo; wife of Fikile Mbalula [the minister of sport and recreation].Pieter Myburg&sbquo; AfriForum&rsquo;s district co-ordinator for Bloemfontein said on Thursday that "R1.3bn was made available by the National Treasury for low-cost housing and the erection of 21,000 RDP houses. Court documents indicate that not a single house has been built up to now."We are no longer going to allow state officials to get away with fraud. Those stealing money from tax payers and leaving the poor without a roof over their heads cannot get off scot-free&sbquo;" said Myburg.TMG Digital

The JSE, rand, bonds and futures were all firmer on Tuesday as resource prices rose while the Constitutional Court case relating to a vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma unfolds.The rand and bonds have suffered as a result of recent moves by Zuma, which began with his recall of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas from an international investor road show. Both Gordhan and Jonas were axed in a subsequent Cabinet reshuffle which resulted in SA being dropped to junk status by two of the world s largest ratings agencies.In a motion brought before the Constitutional Court by the UDM, the court has asked for affidavits from opposing parties. The UDM is requesting an order for a vote of no confidence in Zuma by Parliament to be decided by secret ballot.Improving commodity prices boosted the rand and mining shares with the JSE all share closing 0.74% higher at 53,535.20 points and the blue-chip top 40 adding 0.72%.

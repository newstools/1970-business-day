Mutual &amp; Federal (M&amp;F), the short-term insurance arm of Old Mutual, will rebrand as Old Mutual Insure come June, says CEO Raimund Snyders, parting ways with a 47-year old brand."This will position M&amp;F as a core part of Old Mutual&rsquo;s proposition to customers and group strategy on the continent," Snyders said on Tuesday.The short-term insurance business would remain intact with no shift in strategy, he said. It would now deliver under the Old Mutual banner.The announcement comes as Old Mutual is in the throes of a group split involving the break-up of its four main businesses. Old Mutual Emerging Markets (OMEM) will list on the JSE and maintain a minority stake in Nedbank, as Old Mutual unbundles its controlling stake in the bank to investors.The London-based wealth unit will be separately listed and Old Mutual will sell down its stake in its US asset-management business.Old Mutual Insure will remain a part of OMEM, leveraging the group&rsquo;s footprint on the African continent to sell short-term insurance.The rebrand was a step forward in the journey announced a few years ago, Snyders said. In March 2014, Old Mutual announced that it would reward executives at OMEM, Nedbank and M&amp;F for driving revenue, cost savings and capital synergies between the three businesses.M&amp;F would undertake extensive engagement in the market in the coming months before implementing the change in June, when it would also launch an above-the-line advertising campaign, Snyders said.M&amp;F&rsquo;s origins can be traced to 1831 when its forerunner, the South African Fire and Life Assurance Company was established. Following various mergers and acquisitions, M&amp;F was born.The insurer&rsquo;s engagements with brokers showed that they would continue to support the new brand, Snyders said. "Our brand value sits in the quality of our people and service, and our promise to pay claims."M&amp;F was deliberately making the announcement now, while Old Mutual was also "reinventing" itself, he said.Last week, Old Mutual said it was on track to meet its end-2018 deadline to complete the group split, which could cost as much as &pound;230m, but deliver benefits to shareholders exceeding &pound;2bn.Snyders declined to comment on what M&amp;F&rsquo;s rebrand would cost, saying only that it was "irrelevant" in comparison to the value that would be extracted as a result.

Eskom is facing two inquiries, after Parliament's public enterprises committee&nbsp;decided to initiate an inquiry into Brian Molefe's reappointment as CEO.Earlier on Tuesday, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown said she would to institute an inquiry into procurement at Eskom.The move to probe Molefe's reappointment is supported by the DA, EFF and IFP.The decision was announced on Tuesday by acting committee chairperson Zukiswa Rantho after an engagement by the committee with Brown, her deputy Ben Martins, Eskom chairman Ben Ngubane and members of the Eskom board.Rantho said the committee believed Molefe's reappointment as Eskom CE was illegal unless convinced otherwise.She also asked that the Eskom board provide the committee with all correspondence related to the appointment, as well as written and taped versions of all relevant board meetings.The committee has still to decide on the terms of reference into the inquiry.ProcurementIn a briefing to Parliament s public enterprises committee, Brown said the procurement inquiry would look at the seven inconclusive investigations into Eskom that had taken place in the past five years, as well as current matters.The Department of Public Enterprises has already drawn up the terms of reference for the inquiry, which Brown said would be separate from any inquiry that Parliament would institute.Brown has also supported the idea of a commission of inquiry into the state of capture report by former public protector Thuli Madonsela, saying Eskom CEO Brian Molefe would never be cleared until such an inquiry took place.The minister also told MPs that the long-awaited Shareholder s Management Bill, which would standardise and harmonise the governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), had been submitted to the Cabinet.Brown said the idea was to stop the fragmentation of SOEs, which could do much better on governance.

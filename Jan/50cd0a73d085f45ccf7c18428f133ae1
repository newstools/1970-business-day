Helen Zille has been suspended from the DA with immediate effect, but she has kept her job as Western Cape premier.The former party leader will remain suspended until the outcome of a disciplinary process against her that kicks off on Friday.The suspension is a psychological victory for DA leader Mmusi Maimane, but will have little practical effect.Calls for Zille to resign as premier are mounting, with the latest coming from former DA leader Tony Leon.Zille is barred from participating in party activities, but may participate in caucus work in the Western Cape provincial legislature.She no longer holds a national position in the party, but attends national leadership meetings because of her position as premier. It is understood she has stayed away from meetings since the furore over her tweets on colonialism began.The decision to suspend Zille was taken during a teleconference involving the party s federal executive committee on Wednesday morning, when Zille s representations on why she should not be suspended were discussed.An overwhelming majority of party leaders agreed with the decision to suspend her, said DA federal chairman James Selfe in a statement.The decision to suspend her was taken at a meeting on Saturday, but Zille was given 72 hours to make representations on why she should not be suspended. Her representations ranged from procedural flaws to allegations that a contributing reason for her being charged was that she is not black, according to sources.The premier is also understood to have described the process against her as a sham and vindictive .She said the federal executive had prejudged the matter and had taken a decision to suspend her before asking for the representations.It is also understood that Zille expressed concern in her submission that the suspension would interfere with her government work if it prevented her from participating in the DA provincial caucus.Selfe said in the statement that the suspension would not have any effect on her government work.The party s federal executive agreed on Wednesday that Zille s social media commentary and public utterances in connection with colonialism breaks down public trust, stunts SA s reconciliation imperative and undermines our political project , he said. There is no question that Zille s original tweets and subsequent justifications have damaged our standing in the public mind. We live in a fragile democracy, which means our public representative must, at all times, be sensitive to the legitimate anger that people still feel about our past and its legacy, the statement read.Selfe said that Maimane had pursued every avenue to resolve the matter, but with no success.The federal chairman said Maimane had asked Zille to issue an apology and find a solution to end the impasse, but the premier had refused to take the appropriate action necessary to resolve this unfortunate and damaging matter .Selfe said that Zille s continuing communication about the matter had damaged the party.Despite the damage to the party, Selfe said DA supporters would find strength in its dedication to integrity.Zille could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;

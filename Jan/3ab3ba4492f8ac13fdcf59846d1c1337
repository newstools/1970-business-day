Anglo American has received bids for its New Largo project in SA, as the company continues efforts to exit operations that supply coal to local power plants, according to two people familiar with the process.Seriti Resources Holdings, which agreed to buy thermal coal mines from Anglo American for about R2.3bn in April, was among the bidders for New Largo, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks were private.MTN Group chairman Phuthuma Nhleko s Pembani Group also bid, as did Sipho Maseko and Jabu Mabuza, the CEO and chairman of Telkom, respectively, the people said.The bids are in the range of R1bn, according to one of the sources. The new owners would need to make significant investments to develop the mine, the other source said, without being more specific.The sale of New Largo would help complete Anglo s exit from operations that provide coal to state power utility Eskom Holdings, although the companies have yet to sign a supply agreement for the project.The miner announced a sweeping asset sale programme in February 2016 following a plunge in commodity prices and outlined plans to focus on diamonds, platinum and copper. It has since scaled back some divestment plans as prices have rebounded.Anglo American continued to make progress on the potential sale of its interests in the New Largo project, the company said. It declined to comment on specific bidders, citing confidentiality restraints.Eskom, SA s top coal buyer, has said it wanted suppliers to be black-controlled as the country pushes companies to boost black involvement in the economy as South Africa SA the country pushes companies to boost black involvement in the economy to make up for discrimination during apartheid.New Largo is located in Mpumalanga, near Eskom s Kusile power plant, which will be the utility s biggest at 4,800MW once it is complete.Anglo considered selling New Largo together with the mines bought by Seriti that supply Eskom, but separated the project in an attempt to get a better price, according to one of the people.The sale process was expected to take another three to four months, one of the people said.Bloomberg&nbsp;

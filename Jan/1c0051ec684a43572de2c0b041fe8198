EFF leader Julius Malema has called on young people to rise up and protest against that which aggrieves them just like the youth of 1976.He called on the hundreds of youths gathered in Boipatong for the party s commemoration of youth day to be fearless, unlike their parents and push their way out of poverty.Malema said he was impressed by barricades on the township s roads set-up for protests, saying "that is what you must do when they do not deliver services to you".He said: "the power is in your hands, you have to fight this rot, take it head on and fight corruption and confront corruption and defeat it we must not be comfortable with corruption. When we say to people Zuma [President Jacob Zuma] is stealing our money to Dubai, they don t understand, that is the same money that must build schools."Just like Zuma did in Ventersdorp where he also earlier addressed young people at the national event, Malema made promises to the young people who are currently the most disenfranchised in the labour market.He said the EFF would build factories in communities where unemployment is rife such as Boipatong, to ensure that young people are employed.His party had picked up the "spear", he told the audience, guaranteeing them that the struggle of those who died fighting for freedom in Boipatong would live on through the EFF.He berated parents, saying they had given in and accepted their poor living conditions by continuing to vote the ANC."In SA, our parents are not doing anything -they are folding their arms. When we challenge the corruption our parents say these children are disrespectful. That s what they said about the 1976 youth, if they had listened to their parents, we would not be where we are today. You do not need permission from your parent to get involved in a revolution and fight the rot, colonialism and apartheid," he said.

EFF leader Julius Malema has filed papers at the Constitutional Court to force President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s impeachment."We are resolute in this&sbquo;" Malema said as the party&rsquo;s lawyers carried several boxes of legal documents into the court building.The EFF wants the court to rule that Parliament&rsquo;s speaker&sbquo; Baleka Mbete&sbquo; order action be taken against Zuma.The EFF&sbquo; along with the United Democratic Movement (UDM) and Congress of the People (COPE)&sbquo; are pushing for the court to force Mbete to call for a vote of no confidence in Zuma or to have impeachment proceedings instituted.Malema himself handed over the documents to the registrar of the court.Section 89 of the Constitution says a president can only be impeached by the National Assembly in Parliament as a result of a "serious violation of the Constitution or the law".The section also allows for the removal of a president for "serious misconduct" or an "inability to perform the functions of office".TMG Digital

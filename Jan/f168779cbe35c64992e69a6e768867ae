Zuma s review application is set to be heard in October."We have instructed our lawyers to send a letter to Zuma " Malema said at a media briefing.He made his comments in the light of recent leaked e-mails showing the influence of the Gupta family on the government.Malema said the e-mails revealed a "coup", which he said was an "unpatriotic betrayal"."SA has been stolen right in front of our eyes . We urge all patriotic South Africans to support this call by the EFF by any lawful means necessary including taking to the streets " Malema said.TMG Digital

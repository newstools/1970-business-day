The Congress of the People has laid criminal charges against Police Minister Fikile Mbalula over the Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma protection debacle.The party which laid the charges at the Garsfontein Police Station in Pretoria on Sunday morning contends that Mbalula contravened the Presidential Protection directive by giving Dlamini-Zuma protection she is not entitled to.The Democratic Alliance says it is to ask the Public Protector that she urgently investigate the use of state resources to provide VIP protection to Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma despite the fact that she holds no position that would justify such protection. COPE reported Mbalula to the Police for the abuse of power. In terms of the Presidential Protection Unit s mandate the protection is provided to the president and deputy president of the country including former presidents foreign heads of state and their spouses COPE spokesman Dennis Bloem said.While DA spokesman on police matters Zakhele Mbhele noted that reports on Sunday made it clear that there were spurious security threats on which the Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula was relying to justify this protection."Indeed it is clear that she was receiving VIP protection prior to her arrival at the hotel where the supposed threat occurred " Mbhele said.The fact that he [Mbalula] will not come out and make clear the true basis of these supposed threats make us increasingly concerned that there is an abuse of state resources at play " Mbhele added.Dlamini-Zuma was a firm contender in the succession race for ANC presidency he said."It cannot be that between now and December she will be provided VIP protection at taxpayer expense essentially as preferential treatment in an internal party race."There are vital policing resource issues around South Africa which need attention. South African citizens face threats from criminals in their homes and on our streets on a daily basis and yet a Zuma favourite is provided protection for unsubstantiated threats instead of our people."The Public Protector needs to investigate this as a matter of urgency to ensure that any abuse of state resources is stopped " Mbhele said.TMG Digital

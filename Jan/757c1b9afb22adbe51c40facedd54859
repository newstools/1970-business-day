Bengaluru &mdash; Investec expects higher full-year revenue and operating profit as recovery in equity markets boosted its asset-management and wealth and investment units.The SA-focused bank, which is also listed in London, said it expected its specialist banking businesses to report results for the year to March higher than the previous year&rsquo;s, helped by the UK unit."The UK economy has been performing better than initially expected. However, the possibility of a hard Brexit continues to create uncertainty and could impact overall levels of economic growth," the company said.Investec, which is being investigated with more than a dozen other banks for colluding to rig the rand, said it had not yet received relevant information on precise allegations against it.Investec said last month that SA&rsquo;s Competition Commission&rsquo;s case against the bank was confined to the conduct of a single trader.The company&rsquo;s shares rose about 0.7% to trade at its highest price since July 2015. Over half of its 30-day average volumes were traded by 10.38am GMT on the London Stock Exchange.Investec said it expected its capital ratios, the percentage of a bank&rsquo;s capital to risk-weighted assets, to be within the group&rsquo;s target total capital adequacy range, for the year to March for both Investec plc and Investec Ltd.Common equity tier 1 ratio is expected to remain slightly below the 10% target for Investec Ltd while Investec plc is expected to remain ahead of target.The company also said third-party assets under management rose 24.3% to &pound;151.2bn.Reuters

SA Rugby took a step towards addressing the problem of overseas-based player selection, by ruling that players must have a minimum of 30 Test caps by July this year to be chosen for the Springboks.The policy replaces the existing situation where any player eligible to play for SA could be picked at the discretion of the Springbok coach.The governing body stopped short of an outright ban on overseas-based players &mdash; an understandable position considering the weakness of the rand against the pound and euro.SA Rugby also included a clause allowing the Bok coach to select any player&sbquo; from anywhere in the world in 2019&sbquo; a World Cup year&sbquo; regardless of the number of Test caps he had.The new policy will come into force from July 1&sbquo; forcing players with fewer than 30 caps to return to SA should they wish to be considered for Springbok selection after the home series against France in June.The player most likely to benefit from this new policy is Ulster flank Marcell Coetzee&sbquo; who has 28 Test caps.Coach Allister Coetzee could pick the back rower in at least two of the three Tests against France in June and he would then be eligible for the next two years, even if he stays in Ireland.But others such as prop Steven Kitshoff who was part of the Bok squad last year would have to find a way out of his contract at French club Bordeaux if he wanted to continue his Test career beyond this June, because he only has 10 caps.SA Rugby is also hoping the policy will dissuade newly capped Boks from taking up overseas contracts in the next two years."We are sending a message to young players that if they wish to play for the Springboks then they must remain in SA " Mark Alexander president of SA Rugby, said."But we have also retained flexibility for the coach to select exceptional players who may be based overseas provided they have a proven track record of 30 Tests for the Springboks."How to balance the need to select the strongest possible team against the challenges of having such a large number of players based overseas has been a subject of long debate in our game."We have made this change in what we believe are the best interests of the Springbok team, but we will review it periodically in conjunction with the national coach."TMG Digital

The Evander mine, owned by Pan African Resources, will retrench 976 people, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said on Monday.After talks with management, the NUM said the reduction in jobs at loss-making Evander in Mpumalanga would initially focus on voluntary separation packages and redeployment to other operations within Pan African, which mines gold in Barberton and coal in KwaZulu-Natal. It also has a small platinum recovery operation treating tailings from a chrome mine.The NUM said up to 2,400 jobs were under threat when Evander served the section 189 notice under the Labour Relations Act on unions at the mine, at the end of February.As part of the agreement reached with Pan African, the company would try to "source funds to avoid the closure of the mine, which will affect more than 2,000 employees, whom the majority are our members", the union said.The union&rsquo;s members agreed to the deal with Pan African, giving the NUM their "blessing to sign, so to avoid the closure of the mine".Evander has shut its two shafts for a two-month refurbishment programme that will cost R40m and a further R240m in lost revenue.Pan African said in the section 189 notice that the mine had made losses for seven months, and the expenditure needed at the mine coupled with lost revenue meant the "mine is now financially unsustainable"."Consequently, unless the mine&rsquo;s operating costs are materially reduced and the sustainability of its infrastructure is substantially enhanced &hellip; the mine will need to be placed on indefinite care and maintenance," the company said.Of the 2,435 employees at the mine, Pan African warned that the total underground workforce and some support services totaling 2,000 people could be affected if the mine were placed on care and maintenance. It did not indicate how many employees it needed to retrench.

Judge Raymond Zondo told the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) that should he be appointed deputy chief justice he would ensure that he remained humble.He was being interviewed by the JSC chaired by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng in Midrand on Monday for the position of Mogoeng s deputy.Zondo was nominated by President Jacob Zuma to fill the post left vacant by former deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke."If I am appointed I will remember as I have throughout my career that I come from communities that are very poor. Just because at a certain stage I became a lawyer a judge judge president or justice of the Constitutional Court it doesn t mean I am no longer part of those people " said Zondo."I should always remember that they are very important. If I am appointed as deputy chief justice that will always continue to be my attitude " he said adding that "we shouldn t behave as if we are gods".Zondo is a judge in the Constitutional Court, and has about 20 years of judicial experience. If appointed, he said he would like to begin a debate about changing the way trials were conducted.The judge proposed that trial matters be brought before the courts by way of affidavits as trials were usually dragged out for longer than necessary because parties tended to withhold evidence until it was convenient to present it."Affidavits would force that everyone disclose [what they have] beforehand " he said.Mogoeng has worked alongside Zondo quite well and at times has asked him to take over at events that he could not attend himself.The pair have known each other since 1981 after having met at the University of Zululand. They have been friends since then.Thoko Didiza who was the ANC s mayoral candidate in Tshwane was also one of the JSC commissioners. She also said she had known Zondo for a long time, and that he was "a family friend".Zondo admitted to being nervous as he took as his seat before the commissioners."Despite the fact that I am coming to this commission for the seventh time I am a bit nervous " he said letting out a nervous laugh.Earlier he became emotional as he told the panel about his long path to success.Answering questions posed by Mogoeng Zondo told the panel that after he matriculated he approached an Indian shop owner known as Moosa to ask for a loan to ensure his mother was fed while he went to university to study law.Moosa agreed and every month his mother was allowed to collect groceries worth R20 from his shop.When Zondo completed his degree he returned to pay the loan."But [Moosa] said Don t worry just do to others what I have done to you ," said Zondo reaching for a white handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his eyes.Zondo s appointment to the Constitutional Court five years ago was met with reports that he had always been Zuma s favoured candidate for the post. Zondo rejected the claims.TMG Digital

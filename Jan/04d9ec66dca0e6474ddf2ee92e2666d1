Members of Parliament&rsquo;s ad hoc portfolio committee finalised the list of five members of the SABC interim board on Wednesday.The interim board will be made up of former board member Krish Naidoo; media veterans Mathatha Tsedu and John Mattison; Febe Potgieter-Gqubule, who was until recently the deputy chief of staff for former African Union Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma; and business executive and former CEO of Business Unity SA Khanyisile Kweyama.The interim board will have the task of sorting out the mess at the SABC, including the appointment of a permanent CEO, chief operating officer and chief financial officer.State security agencies must vet the appointments as the SABC is a national key point.The directors will be tasked with implementing the committee s many recommendations.Embattled Communications Minister Faith Muthambi and the SABC have maintained their silence since Parliament adopted a damning report detailing the collapse of governance at the public broadcaster.It blamed the minister for the crisis.The ad hoc committee report, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Tuesday, sharply criticises Muthambi s incompetence in carrying out her responsibilities as the shareholder representative, including by appointing Hlaudi Motsoeneng as permanent chief operating officer. Motsoeneng is blamed for the collapse of successive SABC boards.The report recommends that President Jacob Zuma should "seriously reconsider the desirability of this minister retaining the communications portfolio".Parliament s portfolio committee on communications will discuss the report next week.Zuma will have to decide on Muthambi s fate amid growing calls for her removal.Muthambi s spokesman, Mish Molakeng, said on Wednesday the minister would not comment while Parliament was still considering the report.SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said the broadcaster would not comment on the adoption and the contents of the report as the matter "is about us, but it s not our process".The final report on the SABC crisis by the ad hoc committee recommends that the interim board should implement the remedial action outlined in the public protector s 2014 report.The SABC initially claimed that it had complied with the public protector s recommendations as it had instituted disciplinary proceedings against Motsoeneng, which cleared him of wrongdoing.However, the High Court in Cape Town ruled in December that Motsoeneng was not entitled to occupy any position at the SABC, unless the public protector s report was set aside or new disciplinary proceedings against him were finalised. It said the initial disciplinary hearing had been "wholly inadequate".

Standard Bank&rsquo;s purchasing managers index (PMI) came in above 50 for the sixth consecutive month &mdash; its longest run above 50 in close to three years.While the PMI fell further from December&rsquo;s 21-month high of 51.6 to 50.5, it is still above the 50-point cutoff between expansion and contraction.The monthly poll of purchasing managers is done by research firm Markit for Standard Bank.Standard Bank economist Thanda Sithole said although the PMI was marginally lower than 51.5 in December and 51.3 in January, the reading boded well for SA&rsquo;s economy."This was above the 49.7 average for 2016 and the 50.9 average for the fourth quarter of 2016, indicating gradually improving prospects for economic conditions in the months ahead."Volume of new business increased for the fourth consecutive month but was weighed down by a reduction in new export orders."Demand for domestic exports will remain under pressure should the rand strength persist in 2017," said Sithole.While indices tracking output, new orders, employment and stocks of purchases moderated slightly, they remained above 50.Private sector employment rose for the eighth month running, marking the longest period of job creation in nearly four years.The Absa PMI, released on Wednesday, came in at 52.5 points from January&rsquo;s 50.9 points, marking the highest level in the index since June 2016.

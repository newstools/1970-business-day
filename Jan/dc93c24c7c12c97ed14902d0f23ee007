The eThekwini Municipality has moved to defend an R81&#8218;000 construction bungle which saw four speed bumps &quot;misplaced&quot;.The speed bumps were installed by a contractor in the wrong place on Glen Anil Road in December last year. eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Tozi Mthethwa said no action would be taken against the contractor for the gaffe. &quot;No action is required against the contractor. The existing speed humps will remain as they are serving the purpose of regulating speeds along the road&#8218;&quot; she said. &quot;The construction cost was R81&#8218;000 and this was not a wasteful expenditure because [they are] assisting in regulating speeds along the road.&quot;Mthethwa said that additional speed humps&#8218; placed in the correct location&#8218; will be budgeted for in the 2018-19 financial year.Ward councilor Peter Graham strenuously disagreed and called the entire operation a &quot;muck-up&quot;. &quot;The city saying this is not wasteful expenditure is ridiculous because they were put in the wrong place. The city needs to fix their muck-up here&#8218;&quot; said Graham.He added that the point of the speed bumps was to calm traffic in a residential area and they were, instead, placed in the industrial zone on the same road. &quot;I went on site with a representative of the city and with the actual contractor and they provided me with a map or plan of the road where the speed bumps were meant to be,&quot; he said. &quot;We physically walked up the hill and marked where they needed to be with the specifics of their height and width. A week later I came back and found out they were put in the wrong place.&quot;

The JSE closed lower on Thursday, due mainly to a stronger rand, but banks and platinums gained after the Reserve Bank s decision to keep interest rates on hold. Retail, gold and industrial stocks were weaker on the day.Speculation about the future of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan took a back seat to the Bank s interest-rate decision amid reports that up to 12 Cabinet ministers may resign if Gordhan is axed.The rand recovered more than 20c to R12.8289 against the dollar in late afternoon trade as the Bank announced "We may have reached the end of the tightening cycle". "Today s monetary policy committee s statement supports our view that the next move will be a 25 basis-point cut in the third quarter," said Capital Economics analyst John Ashbourne.The relatively stronger currency played out favourably for banks, whose share values dropped noticeably this week as speculation mounted that Gordhan could lose his job. Banks are closely tied to the health of the economy, which analysts warn could be downgraded to sub-investment grade if Gordhan does, indeed, lose his job suddenly.On Monday, President Jacob Zuma ordered Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, home from an overseas investor roadshow without providing reasons.The all share was 0.35% lower at 52,261.20 points and the blue-chip top 40 dropped 0.41%.

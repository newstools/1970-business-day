The South African bond market extended gains in late trade on Monday as the rand strengthened further below the R13 to the dollar mark.A stronger rand helps rein in inflation, which bodes well for the bond market.The rand, which is one of the key drivers in the bond market, has been relatively resilient to the strong dollar, which has been boosted by the prospect of an increase in interest rates in the US next week.Markets have priced in a more than 80% likelihood of this outcome, after a number of high-ranking US Federal Reserve officials spoke in favour of tighter monetary tightening over the past week or so.ETM Analytics market analyst Ricardo da Camara traced the rand&rsquo;s relative resilience to a belief that the US Fed would adopt a gradual approach in lifting borrowing costs, pending the uncertainty about Donald Trump&rsquo;s economic policy options.As recently as last week, the rand was at R13.18 to the dollar before strengthening to R12.93, pulling the bond market along with it.The local GDP data for the fourth quarter would take centre stage on Tuesday, with Trading Economics expecting the economy to have expanded 0.6% in the fourth quarter, up from 0.2% in the third quarter.

More foreign students have cancelled plans to study at the University of Cape Town (UCT) fearing potential Fees Must Fall protests.This week, Bowdoin College in the US discouraged its students from embarking on an exchange programme with UCT.Christine Wintersteen&sbquo; Bowdoin College director for off-campus study and international programmes&sbquo; was quoted in the college newspaper&sbquo; the Bowdoin Orient as saying the onus lies on students to be responsible."[It] is an issue of jeopardising credit transfer and making sure students can graduate on time and have an academic experience that does involve some academic content&sbquo;" she said.Last year TMG Digital reported that 92 students from various US institutions participating in the study abroad programme at UCT, pulled out. At the time, UCT said it had received 650 applications to be part of the programme for the first semester in 2017.On Wednesday the university disclosed that the number had dropped to 290 students for the first semester, which is due to start on Monday."It is too early to predict numbers for the second semester&sbquo;" he said UCT spokesperson Elijah Moholola. He said the majority of the cancellations were from US students."This is representative of the usual international student population at UCT. Usually 75% of the students are from the US&sbquo; so any attrition is likely to register greater numbers in this group of students&sbquo;" he said.TMG Digital

Financial Mail editor Rob Rose and the Editing Allowed panel debate the ANC National Working Committee s (NWC) decision to stand by President Jacob Zuma, whether S&amp;P s downgrade should have come as a surprise and whether more are to follow.BusinessLive editor Ray Hartley said the ANC choosing to stand by Zuma despite growing calls for him to stand down following the outcry over last week s cabinet reshuffle showed that Zuma was firmly in control of the party. I think it signals a moment where you understand finally that the ANC is actually a subsidiary of Zuma Enterprises and it is acknowledged that the list of cabinet ministers came from elsewhere... What simply emerges is that they have no choice but to accept it. Financial Mail deputy editor Sikonathi Mantshantsha said the uncertainty arising from the reshuffle was digging us deeper into the junk territory .Hartley said it was unlikely that Zuma could be removed before his term ends in 2019. The fact is that Zuma is in charge. He won the day. There was a contest in the NWC and he won so they ve put their hats in the ring and they ve lost. There won t be a challenge to Zuma driven by the ANC... If it happens it will have to happen some other way. Business Day editor-at-large Hilary Joffe said newly appointed Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba had a questionable track record and that under his leadership things were likely to be very different.Watch as the panel debate whether Gigaba is in any way positive for Treasury or the economy.

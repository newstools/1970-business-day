New York Oil prices rose on Tuesday after forecasts of lower US inventories outweighed a pickup in output in Libya, and energy sector stocks helped keep Wall Street little changed.Stocks edged higher and Treasury yields turned slightly positive as US President Donald Trump said his administration is working on changes to bank regulations and his proposed infrastructure bill "may" top $1 trillion.Political risks from a meeting between the US and Chinese leaders, as well as the upcoming French presidential election, kept investors cautious. Earlier, Treasury yields touched their lowest since late February and were not far from their lowest since November.On Wall Street, indexes turned positive as Trump laid out his plans, even if investors have grown weary of his administration s ability to deliver on campaign promises after his effort to reform healthcare stalled in Congress.Trade was high on investors minds ahead of a possibly contentious meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which Trump expects "will be a very difficult one."

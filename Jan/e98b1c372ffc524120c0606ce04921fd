The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has met its deadline to file papers with the Constitutional Court. A source at the court told Timeslive that the papers were filed electronically&sbquo; even though legal papers are meant to be filed in hard copy as well as electronically.The Office of the Chief Justice spokesman Nathi Mncube later confirmed this. "There was a document electronically filed by Sassa. I&rsquo;m not at liberty to discuss details of papers filed with the court&sbquo;" he said.Last week the court demanded an answer as to why Sassa is not ready to pay grants on April 1. The highest court in the land also asked if Sassa had entered a new contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) to pay social grants. If so, the court wants to see the new contract.There have been suggestions a new and illegal contract with CPS could cost billions more. The court ruled in 2014 that the initial contract was unlawful and a new contract with a new entity must be in place from April 2017.Sassa has told the court in four legal filings, during 2014 and 2015, that it would be ready to pay the grants from this year. The court wants to know why it is not ready and who is to blame for the mess.TMG Digital

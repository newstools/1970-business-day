Private education conglomerate Advtech advised shareholders on Tuesday it expected headline earnings per share (HEPS) to be between 37% and 42% higher year-on-year in December 2016 due to a legal settlement.Advtech&rsquo;s share price fell 0.17% to R17.97 after its announcement.Advtech did not provide details of the settlement, although it said in its 2015 integrated report that it had expected a drawn-out 10-year legal battle against Marina and Andry Welihockyj to go to trial in January 2017.The company has been pursuing damages since 2007 against the Welihockyj business, from which Advtech had bought recruitment company Communicate Personnel in 1998. Advtech had sought R130m in damages, plus interest, due to a disagreement over how the final purchase price was determined."Omitting this aspect as well as other corporate action costs will result in normalised earnings per share being between 20% and 25% higher than the comparative period," the company said.Earnings per share were expected to be between 68.8c and 71.3c, and HEPS between 69c and 71.3c.Advtech is expected to release full-year results on March 22.

The motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma will be debated on April 18 amid growing calls for him to step down.National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete confirmed on Wednesday that a special Parliamentary sitting will take place later in April to debate Zuma's position as president.Parliament is currently in recess and was meant to reconvene at the beginning of next month.A majority of Cape Town-based businesses are in favour of closing down on Friday in protest against the sacking of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. According to a survey conducted by the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry, nearly 62% of Cape businesses are prepared to shut up shop on Friday in solidarity with protesters.Anti-Zuma protests are gaining momentum throughout the country with civil society organisations and the DA planning to take to the streets to protest last week s controversial Cabinet reshuffle, which saw Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas fired. A nationwide protest is planned for Friday amid increasing calls for the president to step down.Zuma s decision to sack Gordhan has been cited as one of the reasons why ratings agency S&amp;P Global decided to downgrade SA to sub-investment grade or junk status."The comments of our members make it clear that the number would have been even higher but for the many public holidays in April," said Janine Myburgh, the president of the Cape Chamber. "We have the Easter weekend as well as Freedom Day in April and people tend to add a few days of their annual leave to these holidays, so that makes April a very difficult month for business. Productivity suffers and I can understand that many firms simply cannot afford another paid holiday."In response to the question "Do you believe we have a leadership crisis in the country?", almost 100% of respondents surveyed by the chamber said "Yes". When asked: "Do you support the call for Jacob Zuma to resign?", again, close to 100% of respondents said "Yes".According to the chamber, some of the respondents sent apologies for not supporting the stay-away, pointing out that they had obligations to their customers. "Others relished the opportunity to make a stand with one businessman saying he was giving his staff a day of paid leave and he would buy them all KFC and Coke and they would march together, the chamber said.Union federation Cosatu, in the Western Cape, said it supports the call for Zuma to step down, but believes that all injustices against the people of SA should be treated in the same manner."In the light of this, we demand that workers be allowed to also protest [and demand that] the CEOs of companies that were involved in cartel or collusive behaviour should be removed; the CEOs of companies fraudulently stealing workers pension funds should be removed and criminally charged; the CEOs of the banks involved in price-fixing should also be removed; the corrupt construction companies should have their CEOs removed; those companies moving billions of rands illegally out of the country should be removed," said Cosatu Western Cape leader, Tony Ehrenreich.He also said workers should still be paid every time they go on strike in future for national interest issues and should be given paid time-off on other protest issues."Cosatu is not confused; we know our friends and enemies. We despise all exploiters who treat workers badly and pay them low wages. We are committed to dealing equally with thieves and dishonest leaders in business and government ... When the thieves are with us on the picket lines exposing Zuma, let s make sure our people know them for who they are. Most white employers are marching to protect their inherited privileges and we refuse to partner [with] apartheid thieves," said Ehrenreich.Seven out of 10 South Africans have stated that Zuma should resign as the president of South Africa. This is according to a survey conducted by Kantar TNS from Saturday 1 April to Monday 3 April amongst 1000 South African adults and representative in terms of race, age, gender and province.

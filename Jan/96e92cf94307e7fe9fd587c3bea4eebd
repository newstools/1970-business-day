Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba issued a statement distancing himself from an opinion piece written by his advisor Christopher Malikane in Business Times on Sunday."The nationalisation of banks is not government policy," Gigaba said. In his opinion piece, Malikane called for "expropriation of white monopoly capitalist establishments, such as banks, insurance companies, mines and other monopoly industries, to industrialise the economy".The statement, issued on Tuesday said: "The Ministry of Finance would like to place on record that the opinion piece by advisor to the finance minister, Prof Chris Malikane, was written in his personal capacity as an academic and activist. The views expressed in the opinion piece are not necessarily government policy. Malikane is within his rights as an academic and an activist to contribute ideas to national discourse on any subject."Gigaba said he called on all sectors of South African society to work together and support the work his ministry was doing to avoid further downgrades and, in the medium term, to restore our investment-grade rating. "Minister Gigaba will, this week, hold meetings with foreign investors in Washington at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in this regard."

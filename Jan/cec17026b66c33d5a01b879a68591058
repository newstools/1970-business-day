Group executives of the SABC walked out a little worse for wear after the Standing Committee of Public Accounts (Scopa) briefing on the state broadcaster&rsquo;s annual report on Wednesday. One MP in particular&sbquo; the ANC&rsquo;s Mnyamezeli Booi&sbquo; laid into acting CEO James Aguma for a section of the report that detailed a skills programme for further training for supply chain management employees."You are saying that you are trying to &lsquo;upskill&rsquo; people to improve on procurement &mdash; but we see from our own research where issues of HR [concern] have been opened up by our researchers&sbquo;" Booi said. "There hasn&rsquo;t been good assessment of the people who you are employing. Some of them have criminal records&sbquo; and some don&rsquo;t have certificates. Now&sbquo; who are you really training? And who are we talking to? Who are these 3&sbquo;000 and something people we are dealing with?"Booi said some of the individuals he was referring to did not have verified citizenship&sbquo; and emphasised that the problem surrounding the appropriate vetting of staff was a contributing factor to the R5.1bn of irregular and wasteful expenditure the SABC incurred.He then warned Aguma that Scopa would not be intimidated: "You have got a record in the SABC that when you are being interrogated&sbquo; you threaten people. When people talk about your institution&sbquo; they disappear. We are not going to be threatened&sbquo; and we will get to the bottom of this R5.1bn. That is corruption&sbquo; and we are going to deal with it."In response&sbquo; Aguma said: "The issue of &lsquo;upskilling&rsquo; is with members of the supply chain management team that we have. One of the weaknesses that we picked up [is] that they have not even been vetted as required by the Public Financial Management Act. We, as the SABC, have tried to discuss the vetting issue and it&rsquo;s a matter that is being raised by the unions that if someone is already employed &mdash; how would you go about vetting? But I agree with you that vetting has not been done and that is one area of concern."Aguma added that historically at the SABC&sbquo; "supply chain tended to be a &lsquo;dumping ground&rsquo; for officials&sbquo; so you would find PA&rsquo;s and all sorts there" &mdash; but was interrupted at this point by Scopa chairperson Themba Ngodi&sbquo; who said that it could not be that the supply chain management system was "a dumping ground". Booi, however, interjected&sbquo; saying that at least Aguma was expressing an honest point of view as supply chain management was a large part of the problem at the SABC.The SABC group filed a total loss of R411.6m at the end of March 2016&sbquo; compared to a loss of R131m for the same period the previous year&sbquo; with R3.2bn spent on salaries from R7.9bn revenue.At a later stage in the briefing&sbquo; Booi accused Aguma of lying. "You are misleading us&sbquo; you are lying to us. You and I and your team here&sbquo; we are not done&sbquo;" he said.Aguma has asked the committee for a deadline of May 31 for internal investigations to be finalised. Ngodi closed the briefing by saying he sincerely wanted to see the SABC in a better position. "I am not happy with what you did&sbquo; to give us information at the 11th hour&sbquo;" he said&sbquo; referring to the late release of the annual report on Tuesday night. "That should never ever happen again."TMG Digital

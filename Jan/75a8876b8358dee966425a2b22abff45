Among the proposals [is a call] for the president s consideration for a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture and the recall of the board of Eskom," he said.Federation of Unions of &nbsp;SA general secretary Dennis George said: "We told Fitch that the [ANC national executive committee had] ... to remove [President Jacob] Zuma."Enoch Godongwana, who chairs the ANC subcommittee on economic transformation, said: "Ratings agencies are concerned about ... fiscal consolidation, fiscal policy and growth. They also expressed concern about the political impact on those factors."

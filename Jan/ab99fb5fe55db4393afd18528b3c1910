Amid confirmation from the South African Communist Party (SACP) of media reports that President Jacob Zuma informed them on Monday of plans to reshuffle Cabinet the president has laughed off questions from a journalist on the steps of Parliament.On Thursday, Lester Kiewit of eNCA tweeted a video of Zuma laughing in response to his question.Second deputy-general of the SACP, Solly Mapaila, had confirmed to the media at a press briefing in Johannesburg earlier on Thursday that Zuma s decision to remove Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas was based on a "rogue intelligence report".EFF leader Julius Malema told reporters outside the Constitutional Court on Thursday that the intelligence report in question "could have been written by a child".The EFF was at the court to submit an application to have the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, ordered by the court to act on its submission that Zuma had failed to uphold his constitutional duty by lying to Parliament over upgrades to his Nkandla homestead.TMG Digital

The JSE closed firmer in volatile trade on Monday as industrials and larger mining groups gained on the weaker rand, while gold shares were sold off on the stronger dollar and weaker spot price.The rand lost more than 2% against the dollar in intraday trade after comments by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane on the independence of the Reserve Bank. It later recovered as analysts said it was unlikely that the Constitution would be changed from the present Reserve Bank mandate to ensure price stability, as she suggested."It was far more likely that government would look at other steps, such as introducing prescribed assets or tightening exchange control, before changing the independence of the Reserve Bank," said Capicraft Investment Partners analyst Drikus Combrinck.He said prescribed assets in the bond market was a route taken in the 1980s by the then Nationalist government. It meant institutions would be forced to invest a certain percentage of their assets in bonds."It could lead to a weaker rand," Combrinck said.Banks initially weakened on Mkhwebane s comments before later recovering. Absa, however, was hard hit on the public protector s recommendation that it pay back more than R1bn of a Bankorp lifeboat during the 1980s.Industrials were firmer on a strong performance from Naspers, which jumped nearly 4%, following an earlier subdued response to a trading update indicating an expected annual 4%-10% rise in headline earnings per share to end-March.

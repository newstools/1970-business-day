Former Eskom CEO and newly sworn in MP Brian Molefe has been assigned as a member of the ANC to two portfolio committees in Parliament &mdash; international relations and economic development.The move is surprising as there was widespread speculation that Molefe would join the standing committee on finance as a prelude to his taking over the finance ministry from Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Molefe confirmed his membership of these committees in an interview in the corridors of Parliament on Wednesday.The decision on which committees he would serve arose from Molefe&rsquo;s discussions with ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu and leaders of the ANC caucus.

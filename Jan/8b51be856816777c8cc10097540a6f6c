In a disappointing trading day for investors on Thursday, the JSE all share failed to capitalise on Wednesday s upbeat close as market sentiment remained cautious.The Constitutional Court s rebuke of speaker Baleka Mbete, who said she does not have the authority to allow a secret no-confidence vote in Parliament, failed to lift sentiment on a slightly weaker rand.Analysts said the past three years of almost no growth on the all share had shifted decisively to a bearish mood in the prevailing recessionary conditions."Investor confidence needs to return to the market with comments about tinkering with the Reserve Bank s independence not helpful at all," said BP Bernstein Stockbrokers portfolio manager Vasili Girasis.The all share closed 0.64% lower at 51,072.90 points and the blue-chip top 40 shed 0.59%.

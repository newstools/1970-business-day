Engineering group ELB said on Tuesday that it returned to profitability in the six months to end-December as market conditions improved and a stronger rand provided support.Headline earnings per share (HEPS) came in at R1.42, marking a turnaround from a loss of 51c in the year-earlier period, which was marked by foreign-exchange losses and costs associated with the restructuring of the business.The group provides materials handling and modular plants to the mining, minerals, power, port, construction and industrial sectors, mainly in Africa and Australasia."The group continues with a number of initiatives to position itself to achieve sustainable growth, for which returns will typically only be realised in the future," the company said in a statement."These initiatives are all in line with the core expertise of the group and will enhance its ability to service its markets via horizontal or vertical diversification."The initiatives include the further diversification into providing biomass, gas and energy from waste power plants up to 50MW and the development of expertise in the industrial sector, specifically in the fast moving consumer goods field.

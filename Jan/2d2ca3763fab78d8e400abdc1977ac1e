North West premier Supra Mahumapelo has taken the DA s provincial leader Joe McGluwa to court for what he says are defamatory statements.The premier made the comment while answering questions posed to him on Thursday in the North West legislature."I am going to come after you until I get you where I want you. Because it has been long and I have been patient with all the bitter things that you have been saying about me " Mahumapelo told McGluwa.A letter from Obakeng Kgomo of Kgomo Attorneys dated January 15 2017 stated that in December 2016, McGluwa had made statements to the media alleging that the premier had made unilateral decisions to squander millions of rand on a private jet.The letter says McGluwa alleged that Mahumapelo used community projects to canvass support for the ANC and that his open affiliation with the Guptas made him untrustworthy.It said McGluwa had said Mahumapelo was more concerned with protecting President Jacob Zuma and campaigning for the next president of the ANC than delivering as the premier.According to the letter the decision to buy the private jet was not Mahumapelo s but the provincial executive committee s.Mahumapelo said the allegations had damaged his reputation in that he was no longer regarded as deserving of the respect that was accorded to him.TMG Digital/SowetanLIVE

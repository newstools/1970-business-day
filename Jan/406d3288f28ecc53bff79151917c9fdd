In redeploying former communications minister Faith Muthambi to the crucial public service and administration portfolio, President Jacob Zuma has effectively shown Parliament the proverbial middle finger.The minister, blamed for the crisis at the SABC, is now in charge of a more demanding portfolio. She will now be responsible for labour relations, conditions of service and other employment practices for government employees.Zuma appointed Ayanda Dlodlo, a close ally, as minister of communications. She was previously deputy minister of public service and administration.Earlier in March, Parliament adopted a damning ad hoc committee report detailing the collapse of governance at the SABC, which blamed Muthambi for the crisis.The ad hoc committee report sharply criticises Muthambi s incompetence in carrying out her responsibilities as the shareholder representative, including confirming Hlaudi Motsoeneng as the SABC s permanent chief operating officer.Motsoeneng is blamed for the collapse of successive SABC boards. The report says the minister should be investigated by the ethics committee for possibly breaching the ethics code and the Constitution, and thereafter the president should decide the minister s fate.It recommends that Zuma "seriously reconsider" the desirability of having Muthambi in the Cabinet.Muthambi has launched a legal challenge over the ad hoc committee s report, which she labels "irrational and unlawful".Her last key decision as communications minister was to effectively block the SABC interim board from beginning its work. She instructed members of the board not to start work until they have been vetted by the Department of State Security.DA MP and communications spokeswoman Phumzile van Damme argued that the Broadcasting Act does not require security vetting of the interim board.The act stipulates short timelines for the board s nomination and appointment so that the public broadcaster is not without a board for any length of time."The SABC has been without a full constituted board since September 2016, and further delays can most certainly not be afforded," Van Damme said.The South African Democratic Teachers Union ( Sadtu) said on Friday it has received "with utter dismay and disappointment" the news that Muthambi has been appointed as the new Minister of Public Service and Administration."We wish to put it on record that we do not support the President s decision in this regard and we firmly believe that it is ill-timed, ill-informed and defies all laws of logic," Sadtu said in a statement."We are shocked that the President appoints an individual who had spectacularly failed in her previous portfolio into the Public Service and Administration Department."It is under Minister Faith Muthambi that the public broadcaster the SABC limped from one crisis to another . Amongst others, she failed to ensure that SA met its digital migration deadline so that there can be faster broadband services in the country; this was one of her key deliverables in the previous portfolio."The decision by the President indicates that we have a government that rewards mediocrity and that there are no consequences for those who fail to deliver," the union said."The President through this bizarre decision to make such an appointment has failed to show any appreciation and sensitivity for labour peace in the public service."Meanwhile, all eyes will now be on Muthambi s successor, Dlodlo, who will be tasked with turning around the fortunes of the troubled public broadcaster.Dlodlo, a former presidential adviser, was recently accused of wasting taxpayers money after spending nearly R1.5m on two cars in the space of 18 days.On June 2 2016 an Audi A8 3.0 TDI Quatrro Tip-tronic was purchased for R750 000 and on June 20 2016 an Audi A7 Sportback 3.0 TDI Tip-tronic was bought for R735 700.Dlodlo, who holds a number of postgraduate management qualifications, has worked for Telkom and Sanlam in various portfolios such as human resources, transport, strategic information and industrial relations.She is also a former secretary-general of the uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association.

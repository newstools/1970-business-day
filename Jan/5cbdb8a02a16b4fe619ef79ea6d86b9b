Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has been under pressure in the last few weeks, and on Friday the pressure mounts. That is D-day for her to give reasons to the Constitutional Court as to why she should not be held personally accountable for the grants debacle.Dlamini&rsquo;s department had failed to uphold an agreement it made with the court that they would have a system in place, which would result in her department cutting out the middleman and taking over the payments for 17-million grant recipients.This failure forced the court s hand to extend a contract between the Department of Social Development and Cash Paymaster Systems which has been responsible for the payments of the grants.Two years ago the Constitutional Court declared the contract invalid but had allowed it to proceed while the department readied itself to take over.Dlamini s affidavit to the court was expected to contain explanations about the way she handled the matter and why she should be exempted from personally footing the legal bill for the crisis, which landed her department before the court.Dlamini has already stated that she has taken responsibility for her department s failure to comply with the 2013 Constitutional Court ruling.Meanwhile this report to the Constitutional Court will be the first of several to come in the next few weeks.The court has further ordered that she report to the court every three months about her department s state of readiness in getting their own independent grant-distributing system up and running by March 2018.TMG Digital

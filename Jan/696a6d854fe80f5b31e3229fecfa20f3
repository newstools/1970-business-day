The DA has welcomed the Johannesburg High Court judgment setting aside the controversial Swifambo Rail Leasing contract.DA spokesman on transport Manny de Freitas said that Swifambo&#8218; which had no previous experience in the rail industry when it won the tender in March 2013&#8218; was contracted to supply 70 new locomotives to Prasa at a cost of R3.5bn. The company received an initial payment of R460m and supplied 13 locomotives but they were too tall and thus unsuitable for South Africa&#8217;s railways.&quot;It was also alleged that the ANC were beneficiaries of an R80m bribe aimed at securing the deal for Swifambo&#8218; with payments made to Zuma-aligned Maria de Cruz Gomes for business unrelated to Prasa&#8217;s operations. The DA has already previously laid charges in this regard in 2016&#8218;&quot; De Freitas said.The judgment stated that &quot;harm will be done to the administration of justice&quot; and &quot;corruption will triumph&quot; if the court did not set aside the tender.&quot;This is an indictment on Prasa and exposes how flawed the procurement procedures of Prasa and many other state-owned entities (SOEs) are.&quot;The judgment is thus welcomed as it reaffirms the strength of the country&#8217;s judiciary and gives us hope that more SOEs can be rescued from state capture&#8218; corrupt ANC officials and unscrupulous &#8216;businesspeople&#8217;&#8218;&quot; De Freitas said.

Senior SABC journalist Suna Venter, one of the eight rehired after being fired by the broadcaster in 2016, was found dead in her flat on Thursday.The 32-year-old was one of the group known as the SABC Eight who received the Nat Nakasa Award for bravery in 2016 after they challenged the SABC s illegal editorial policies and undue influence in the newsroom. Over the past year, Venter received death threats and was intimidated, assaulted, abducted and shot, following the stance she took at the SABC.Venter, who was a senior producer of Radio Sonder Grense (RSG) current affairs programmes, was recently diagnosed with stress cardiomyopathy, better known as broken heart syndrome . The condition is said to be caused by trauma and prolonged periods of unnatural stress. Those closest to her believe that her condition was exacerbated, if not caused, by the events of the past year, her family said in the statement.Foeta Krige, executive producer of RSG Current Affairs, said Venter did not arrive at work on Wednesday and was found in her Johannesburg flat. He said she had developed an extremely high heart rate after a break-in in March.Venter had a deep love of Syria and visited the country in December. She would have covered the ANC policy conference this weekend, Krige said.For the past year, her aim had been to establish an independent newsroom free from interference within the SABC.Krige called Venter one of the most dedicated and passionate journalists he ever had the pleasure of working with.When doctors advised her to leave the stressful environment at the SABC, she replied she could not go before the battle was won, the family said.Venter is survived by her parents Phillip and Christa, and her siblings Wilhelm and sister Tessa.

The JSE closed weaker on Monday as Naspers tumbled more than 6% in intra-day trade in its sharpest daily fall so far this year, after a US technology stock rally was reversed in Asian markets.Tech stocks drove the US Nasdaq to a record high last week, but concern over high valuations led to a sharp correction on Monday.Market heavyweight Naspers, trading at a price-earnings ratio of 100, fell after its Chinese Tencent investment, of which it owns 34%, dropped more than 2% in Hong Kong trade.Naspers closed 5.89% lower at R2,525, its lowest level in two months. Naspers has been a firm, big-stock favourite on the JSE so far this year, gaining close to an annual 40% growth at one point.Analysts said Naspers also partially retreated on a stronger rand, with the local currency firming 0.6% to R12.8229 to the dollar on the day. The rand is up 6% against the dollar so far in the year, despite Moody s downgrade announcement on Friday."Naspers is a rand hedge and a combination of rand strength and foreign-earned revenues was not likely to be helpful to its rand value," said Investec analyst Brian Kantor.When the rand gains 20% on the dollar, it takes a more than 20% annual appreciation in the dollar value of a dual-listed stock to translate into an increase in its rand value, he said. "Naspers has been able to reach this rate of return, which few other global players on the JSE have been able to meet."Banks and financials gained on the stronger rand with property also rising in a relief rally after Moody s one-notch downgrade and the prospect of an interest-rate cut by the Reserve Bank later in the year.On Friday evening, Moody s cut its sovereign credit rating for SA to Baa3 from Baa2, one notch above junk.Moody s held its outlook on SA as negative, raising the fear of another downgrade in December.Market focus has turned to the outcome of Wednesday s US federal open market committee meeting.

Top Gear will return to local screens on March 8 and petrol-heads can look forward to devouring some exclusive footage as the team takes the ultra rare LaFerrari FXX-K for a spin.There are only 40 units of the FXX-K in the world. Owners don&rsquo;t get to take their babies home; Ferrari keeps them. The car is not sold on an open market but offered exclusively to the brand&rsquo;s most loyal customers. There are plans to use model, which is priced from $2.7m, in competition.The Top Gear team had to insure the driver, the car and the track &mdash; but would not be drawn into how much it cost to do so.Aside from the FXX-K there will be several TV debuts for some of the world&rsquo;s most expensive and exclusive super-cars. The new hosting trio of Matt LeBlanc, Rory Reid and Chris Harris will also ride "regular people" cars.Speaking to BDlive, Reid said he would drive anything: "You&rsquo;ll see in this series that there are some cars you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily associate with Top Gear, like the Renault Twingo, which is this little French hatchback &hellip; You wouldn&rsquo;t expect to see it on the world&rsquo;s biggest motoring show. But we work with an amazing team of producers who come together to make a really cool idea that suits that car, and you end up with this unforgettable piece of TV where no other car could have worked in that situation."Harris, who got to drive the FXX-K around the Daytona International Speedway, said he was massively lucky: "I&rsquo;ve driven some great cars this season; I suspect I&rsquo;ll get less lucky in the future."This will be the 24th season of Top Gear, which had a less than inspiring start to the revamped series last year &mdash; the main host, Chris Evans, quit the show after ratings fell to all time lows.Top Gear will air on BBC Brit, on DStv channel 120.&bull; Goko was recently in the UK as a guest of the BBC during the broadcaster&rsquo;s annual worldwide showcase

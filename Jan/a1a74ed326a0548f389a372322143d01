The JSE closed lower on Thursday on broad-based losses led by platinums and retailers retreating after the Reserve Bank painted a dim picture of the economy in its repo-rate statement on Thursday.The Bank kept the rate unchanged at 7%.The rand gained in response to the possibility of rates remaining at present, higher levels for longer, firming to R12.8464 to the dollar from $12.8957 after the JSE s close.Platinum stocks were lower on a stronger rand and on Moody s downgrade earlier in the week of China s sovereign credit rating, despite the platinum price gaining 0.80% to $953.74 an ounce in late trade.The Reserve Bank said the domestic growth outlook has deteriorated amid weak business and consumer confidence. This is despite the Bank lowering the average local consumer inflation outlook for this year to 5.7% from 5.9%, and after aligning GDP growth to the International Monetary Fund s 1% for 2017.The Bank s decision was described by Capital Economics economist John Ashbourne as reflecting a "a mildly dovish tone". Analysts said there was widespread disappointment that the Bank did not cut rates on the better-than-expected consumer inflation data earlier in the week to lift local growth prospects.The possibility of a rate cut has now been shifted to later in the year. "We think the Bank will cut the repo rate by 50 basis points to 6.5% in the third or fourth quarter," Ashbourne said.PPS analyst David Crosoer said continued domestic political uncertainty and the prospect of further US rate hikes gave the monetary policy committee little choice but to err on the side of caution.The recent negative moves in SA s sovereign rating and continuing political noise has raised inflation risks and lowered growth prospects, said Momentum Investments economist Sanisha Packirisamy.The JSE showed little reaction to a firmer opening on the Dow and marginally stronger European markets as the lower oil price left it unmoved.

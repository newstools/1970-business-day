The JSE closed lower on Wednesday as the market succumbed for the second successive session to a combination of lower commodity prices and economic growth concerns, with general retailers and platinums leading the losses.Statistics SA said on Tuesday that the economy grew a paltry 0.3% in 2016, with growth turning negative in the fourth quarter.Gold and resources stocks also closed lower on the day despite the rand pulling back 1% against the dollar ahead of an expected interest rate hike in the US next week. The rand was at R13.0879 against the dollar in late trade, from a previous close of R12.9738.Trading was cautious ahead of the release of US non-farm payroll data set to be released on Friday. The consensus view is that non-farm jobs increased 190,000 in February from 227,000 in the previous month.The all share closed 0.15% lower at 51,300 and the blue-chip top 40 softened 0.03%.

Industrials and food and drug retailers each added 0.16%.After gaining 26% in 2016, the resources 10 index has lost 3.5% since January this year. The stronger rand has also affected mining stocks due to earning the biggest part of their profit in dollars.Ashburton fund manager Wayne McCurrie said mining shares have performed spectacularly well over the past 14 months, "But now the focus has shifted to diversified mining shares at the expense of single commodity and resource-related industrial shares".Among the big miners, BHP Billiton retreated 2.12% to R208.35.

A mob of angry commuters hijacked a passenger train on Wednesday night&sbquo; forcing the driver to head into KwaMashu instead of going to Stanger&sbquo; north of Durban.According to a statement released by the United National Transport Union (Untu)&sbquo; Metrorail train 0277 was commandeered by commuters. The train was not scheduled to stop in KwaMashu&sbquo; but the commuters wanted it to&sbquo; leading to the hijacking."Zina Katzen [the driver] was on route from Durban to Stranger when commuters forced her, at Duffs Road, to go to KwaMashu&sbquo;" Untu said in the statement.In a separate incident&sbquo; train driver Jesse Selvan was on the phone to the operational centre asking for assistance when her manager overheard commuters threatening to kill her."Residents in the surrounding squatter camps and commuters were furious because trains from Transnet Freight Rail were allegedly causing delays on the railway lines. The problems started due to cable theft and the theft of signals in the area&sbquo;" the union said.Steve Harris&sbquo; general secretary of Untu&sbquo; says all hell broke loose."Security was beefed up. Extra measures, like security escorts and assistance from the South African Police Service, have been put in place. Both lines are open today."Train crews are being escorted from Phoenix to Duffs Road and between Effingham and KwaMashu. The rapid rail police of the SAPS are on the scene [at] Duffs Road, with members of the protection services to ensure that the situation remains stable&sbquo;" he said.TMG Digital

Western Cape premier Helen Zille is jetting off to Singapore and Japan, with the aim of boosting trade between her province and the two countries. One of the Western Cape&rsquo;s plans is to become a big player in the global $2.3-trillion halaal market. A proposed R1bn halaal agri-processing food park in the province is still on the table and officials hope it will allow the province to increase its share in the fast-growing market."Our halaal issuing authorities are well accepted in Singapore&sbquo; where no additional local work on halaal certification is required. Singapore has excellent access to the broader Asia region&sbquo; where their halaal certification is widely accepted (including countries such as Indonesia)&sbquo;" a statement from Zille&rsquo;s office read. "It is hoped that access to Singapore will open opportunities for further trade with neighbouring countries&sbquo; since they hold processed products coming through Singapore in high regard."Her visit to Singapore is set for March 9 to 11, then it is off to Japan &mdash; SA&rsquo;s third largest trade partner &mdash; where she is expected to stay until March 15."Over 100 Japanese companies with investments in SA provide skills development&sbquo; training and advancement to their South African employees (South African nationals) and contribute to the transfer of technologies&sbquo;" the statement continued. "Premier Zille will have an opportunity to engage with some companies that have invested in Cape Town and further address high-level business stakeholders on the investment opportunities available in the province."TMG Digital

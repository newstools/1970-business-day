The rand was marginally weaker against the dollar on Tuesday afternoon, but remained resilient after three weeks of domestic political uncertainty.During the Easter holiday, the rand traded below the R13.50/$ level and strengthened to R13.26/$ in intra-day trade earlier on Tuesday.Rand Merchant Bank analyst John Cairns said the rand continued to do surprisingly well even though a mild dollar recovery would, in turn, restrict the rand. The bias on the rand remains in favour of gains, despite the domestic problems, he said.Momentum SP Reid analysts said the dollar trading at about 1.0580 to the dollar now represented a near term-hurdle for the greenback, which created the potential for an improved tone in the rand. Domestic political developments would determine whether the rand gained further traction, they said.At 15.30pm, the rand was at R13.3513 to the dollar from Thursday s R13.3171, R14.2746 to the euro from R14.1717 and at R17.0043 to the pound from R16.7268.The euro was at $1.0692 from $1.0641.

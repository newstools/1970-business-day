The DA has called on President Jacob Zuma to hand negotiations of the grant payment process to Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, after the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) withdrew its 11th-hour application to the Constitutional Court.Sassa had lodged an urgent application with the court on Tuesday, asking it to extend a social grants distribution contract that the court invalidated in 2014.However, on Wednesday it said it was withdrawing the application because some "inputs were not included".Spokesman Kgomotso Diseko said it would be relodged but could not say when.Sassa officials on Tuesday admitted in Parliament that the agency had no plan to distribute more than 17-million social grants to over 11-million beneficiaries other than to extend Net 1 subsidiary CPS&rsquo;s contract.In court papers, the agency said it did not have the capacity to distribute the social grants and said grant payments would be in jeopardy come April 1 if the court turned down its urgent application.DA MP and social development spokeswoman Bridget Masango said the withdrawal of the application raised a number of questions."Is the minister nervous of what could happen should the Constitutional Court make adverse comments on her conduct? Is she nervous of the possible consequences to her political future? And most importantly, what is going to happen to the 17-million South Africans who rely on social grants to stay alive?"Masango said Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini could not be trusted with the livelihoods of millions of poor South Africans.Dlamini&rsquo;s office could not be reached for comment."The president must appoint National Treasury to take the lead role in the negotiations for a new service provider, in terms of Section 97 of the Constitution, in order to ensure that this process is cost effective and transparent."The DA was consulting with lawyers to explore possible avenues for the party to take to ensure a legal grant payment process.

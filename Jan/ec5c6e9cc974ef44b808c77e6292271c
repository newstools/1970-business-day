In a considerable change of tack, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba announced a forensic investigation into the Tegeta report submitted to Parliament s standing committee of public accounts (Scopa), days after he wrote to the committee seeking its withdrawal.Earlier this week, Gigaba confirmed to Scopa chairperson Themba Godi that the report sent to Scopa relating to the coal supply contracts between Tegeta and Eskom was not complete and was submitted as a final report in error. His office also said he wanted to ensure the finalised report had "legal muster" and had remedial actions National Treasury could enforce.Godi said Gigaba asked that the report be "withdrawn". "This letter serves to correct the error indicated above and to inform you that the final report will only be submitted to the committee after July 30 2017 or once National Treasury has finalised it," Gigaba wrote.However, in a statement on Friday, the Ministry of Finance said Gigaba had directed National Treasury to kick off a forensic investigation into the report. The matter has already been the subject of a handful of investigations."[The] director general signed off for the forensic investigation on July 26 2017. Treasury has reviewed the enforceability of the report and the report sent to Scopa still stands. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said that governance and accountability at state-owned enterprises remained a priority," a statement from the ministry said.

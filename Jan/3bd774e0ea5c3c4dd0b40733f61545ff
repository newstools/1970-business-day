The JSE s all-share index closed lower on Wednesday in cautious trade as the market sought direction following Tuesday s recession news.Market sentiment was influenced by views that the Reserve Bank may have to consider rate cuts sooner than its present, gradual stance as the rand remained reasonably stable on the recession news.The Bank has said previously that its cycle of interest-rate increases might have come to an end, but that it was too early to contemplate cuts. "The Reserve Bank will likely keep rates on hold to keep inflation in check, despite mounting pressure for a rate cut to stimulate growth," said TreasuryOne analyst Phillip Pearce.At the same time, the announcement of a 0.7% economic contraction could accelerate further credit rating downgrades as the market awaits the decision from Moody s, he said.Analysts said movements in the rand are key to the Bank s rate decision. Although the expectation has been for the rand to weaken on the recession news, it has held up well amid continued foreign buying of local bonds.Despite the poor macro-economic data, the overall yield differential still favours the rand, creating fertile conditions for further improvement, said Momentum SP Reid analysts.The local market was also eyeing important global developments, including the British election on Thursday and former FBI director James Comey s testimony in the US congress.Market expectations that the European Central Bank (ECB) would send out a more hawkish message at its meeting on Thursday abated on Wednesday after reports of a draft ECB staff projection showed growth forecasts being revised higher and inflation lower until 2019."Should this be the case, it would support the need for ECB monetary policy to remain very accommodative and either delay tapering or at least slow its pace," said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam.The euro weakened marginally to the dollar in response.Commodity prices trended weaker, providing little support for the JSE as oil prices retreated.

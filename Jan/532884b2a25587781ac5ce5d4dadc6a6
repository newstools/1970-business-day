Workers at First National Bank (FNB) say the bank suspended one of its employees over a deposit slip linked to former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe, according to Sowetan newspaper.At the centre of the issue was controversy over Molefe&rsquo;s membership of an ANC branch in the North West.Two weeks ago the ANC in ward 29 branch in Madibeng had produced two of Molefe&rsquo;s ANC membership forms during a media conference, in a bid to defend the party&rsquo;s decision to appoint him as an MP.According to Sowetan on Friday, one of the documents produced by ANC members during the media briefing showed a bank stamp, which reflected "back office" instead of a teller number.Sowetan quoted ward 29 secretary Christina Malulu, who had been vocal about Molefe not being a member of her branch, saying she suspected that someone at FNB had assisted Molefe to back date the stamp, to make it look as if he had been their branch member for many years.ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa was quoted as saying the party was due to meet management at FNB.

The Eskom board on Thursday said it has decided to immediately undertake a forensic and legal investigation into allegations that the step-daughter of interim group CEO Matshela Koko benefited from Eskom contracts worth about R1bn.Legal firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr has been instructed to conduct the investigation into the potential conflict of interest relating to Koketso Choma s shareholding in engineering and project management company Impulse International. It will appoint an independent auditing firm to assist with the forensic investigation.The board took the decision at a meeting on Tuesday and then informed Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown about it. According to her spokesman, Colin Cruywagen, the minister asked the board to address the matter as swiftly as possible, asking that it be concluded within 30 days instead of the 90 days initially envisaged.&nbsp;Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe denied rumours that Koko had been suspended pending the investigation.The allegations against Choma Koko is married to her mother were made in a report in the Sunday Times this week. She was appointed a director of Impulse last April and, over the following eight months, according to the report, the company received eight lucrative contracts from the generation division which Koko headed up until he was appointed acting CEO in December.The report said Impulse had been awarded contracts of about R1.8bn since 2014, of which R1bn were awarded while Choma was a director. She has since resigned from the company. Koko told the Sunday Times that he only became aware of his step-daughter s shareholding in Impulse last month"The allegations in the public domain have a corrosive impact on the social standing of Eskom, as a brand, as well as its entire leadership," Eskom chairman Ben Ngubane said in a statement. "As the board, we have a constitutional mandate to probe these allegations, with a view to getting to the unassailable truth of the situation. The objective of the investigation will be to ascertain whether the allegations can be corroborated and/or substantiated by evidence including real and/or documentary evidence."Ngubane said the board would not interfere with the development of the scope of the investigation and had decided to leave this for Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr to craft. He stressed that the board would not hesitate to implement the recommendations arising from the investigation.

That worry also sent the dollar to a four-and-a-half-month low against a basket of currencies on Monday.This makes dollar-denominated gold cheaper for holders of other currencies, potentially boosting demand. "The dollar has come under a lot of pressure and lifted gold," said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke. "Changing perceptions of the outlook for US interest rates will create volatility in gold." The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates this month, boosting the dollar, which could strengthen further on expectations of further rises after comments from its policymakers. However, some analysts expect to the Fed to keep rates on hold for some time, leaving the dollar to drift lower."Dollar weakness is something that could propel prices higher, especially in light of the latest CFTC report that shows dollar longs building for a third week in a row despite ongoing weakness," INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said in a note.Investor demand for gold can be seen in the world&rsquo;s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, New York-listed SPDR Gold Shares, which reported an inflow of 2.7 tonnes on Monday.Traders see technical resistance around $1,260, near the 200-day moving average, while support is expected to kick in at a Fibonacci retracement level of about $1,245.In other metals, spot silver gained 0.3% to $18.12 an ounce and platinum slid 0.1% to $962.7.

London &mdash; Oil prices recovered modestly from three-month lows on Tuesday before the release of the latest US inventory figures and despite few clear signs that Opec will extend supply curbs beyond June.The immediate focus for investors is Tuesday&rsquo;s data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) about US crude and product stockpiles after a bigger-than-expected climb reported last week. Analysts see a further, though smaller, rise this time."Right now, the direction of travel is more important than the absolute level," said Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity strategy at BNP Paribas, citing concern that Opec-led cuts agreed for January-June had not halted the build.By 10.52am GMT, Brent futures had risen 35c to $51.70 a barrel after sliding on Monday to $50.85, their lowest level since December 1.US crude rose 27c to $48.67 a barrel, after dipping in the previous session to $47.90, its lowest price since November.Matt Stanley, commodities broker at Freight Investor Services, said: "This week is crucial to give us an idea of where prices will be for the rest of the year. All eyes will be on API data later &mdash; a sniff of another big crude build and down we go towards $45."Investors will also be watching Opec&rsquo;s monthly report to be released on Tuesday, followed by a report from the International Energy Agency on global supply and demand on Wednesday.Crude prices have erased most of the gains made since Opec announced agreement on supply curbs on November 30 followed in December by an announcement that some non-Opec producers would join the cuts.Opec opted for supply cuts to stabilise prices and draw down global inventory. Investors are looking for indications that Opec will extend cuts after June.Saudi ally Kuwait said on Monday it would support an extension of the global deal. "It will speed up rebalancing of the market and will help bring prices to acceptable levels for oil-producing nations and the industry in general," said Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq.But Saudi Arabia, the world&rsquo;s biggest oil exporter which cut output by more than it had pledged in the Opec deal, has not said yet if it is ready to extend.Reuters

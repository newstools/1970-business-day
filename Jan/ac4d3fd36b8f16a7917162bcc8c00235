The rand was weaker against major global currencies on Friday afternoon, even though it had regained some ground from its lowest intra-day levels.The day saw the axing of the Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan who was replaced with Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, with a host of other ministerial reshuffles.The local currency weakened to R13.63 to the dollar, R17 to the pound and R14.55 to the euro in reaction to the axing of the finance minister.Investec economist, Annabel Bishop, said the local currency had recovered about 20c on market trading but was at risk of marked depreciation. "Markets fear a loss of fiscal consolidation in terms of the planned reduction in the fiscal deficit and public-sector debt over the medium-term expenditure period," she said.The market still has to gain confidence in the new finance minister and will eagerly await his first address where Bishop said Gigaba can "reassure markets that he will achieve fiscal consolidation and prevent erosion of the public finances, and the rand could then strengthen".The market should, however, be taking advantage of the weakening local currency. TreasuryOne dealer, Wichard Cilliers, said local exporters could be taking advantage of current rand levels. Importers should hedge invoice for invoice if they can hold off payments for next month, else buy dollar-to-rand on dips below R13.25.At 3.30pm, the rand was at R13.3401 to the dollar from R13.2644, at R14.2646 to the euro from R14.1566 and R16.6260 to the pound from R16.5395. The euro was at $1.0693 from $1.0673.

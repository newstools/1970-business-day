Seoul South Korea s new president, Moon Jae-in, and US President Donald Trump agreed on "close co-operation" in dealing with North Korea s nuclear weapons programme, Seoul s presidential office said.In their first phone call since Moon s inauguration, the two leaders "agreed on close co-operation in resolving security concerns on the Korean peninsula including North Korea s nuclear ambitions," the Blue House the official residence of the South Korean head of state said in a statement.Calling Pyongyang s atomic weapons programme a "a difficult problem that can be solved", Trump invited Moon to visit the US "as early as possible", according to the statement.Moon was sworn in on Wednesday, just a day after a landslide election victory following the ousting of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, over a massive corruption scandal.Moon backs engagement with the nuclear-armed North in the quest for peace in contrast to the threatening rhetoric from the Trump administration in recent weeks and has immediately declared his willingness to visit Pyongyang."If needed I will fly to Washington immediately," Moon said in an inauguration speech after taking the oath of office in front of legislators at Seoul s National Assembly building."I will also go to Beijing and Tokyo and even Pyongyang in the right circumstances."But Trump recently appeared to offer the prospect of a diplomatic off-ramp last week, saying he would be "honoured" to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un under the right conditions.AFP

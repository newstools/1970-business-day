The JSE retreated to its weakest point in just more than two months on Thursday, as the correction in resources gathered momentum in sympathy with underlying commodity prices.The all share index was off 0.72% to 50,932.80 points at lunchtime, as the resource 10 index dropped 1.83%, extending losses to about 15% since the index&rsquo;s peak in January.The commodity market is partly labouring under a strong dollar, which tends to move inversely to commodity prices, as markets continued adjust to the high probability of an interest-rate increase in the US next week.Platinum has dropped 7% since peaking at just more than $1,000 an ounce in February, with copper dropping by a similar margin after rallying through $6,000 per tonne, which was the best level since 2015.Earlier on Thursday, BHP Billion chief financial officer Peter Beaven warned shareholders that Chinese demand for iron ore and other commodities was slowing down.The relatively stronger dollar was also the main drag on the rand, which slipped to session lows of R13.26 to the dollar, proving a mild support to some big industrial companies such as British American Tobacco and Steinhoff."We are trading almost perfectly in the middle of a trading range that the top 40 has been in for the past three years, so making a call here it is kind of difficult," said Petri Redelinghuys, founder of Herenya Capital Advisors.Europe&rsquo;s leading markets were weaker at midday, following their counterparts in Asia, where Hong Kong&rsquo;s Hang Seng lost 1.18%.Among some individual shares, BHP Billiton was off 3.11% to R201.86, with Anglo American dropping 2.99% to R186.28. Assore retreated 4.37% to R244.82 and Africa Rainbow Minerals lost 4.51% to R95.07.British American Tobacco dropped 1.29% to R819.33 and Steinhoff gained 1.17% to R63.22.

London &mdash; Gold fell half-a-percent on Friday and was on track for its biggest weekly loss in nearly four months as speculation grew that the US Federal Reserve would press ahead with a rate increase this month.The probability of a Fed move in March rose to nearly 80% on Friday from less than 20% two weeks ago, money markets indicated, after hawkish comments from New York Fed chief William Dudley and San Francisco Fed President John Williams.Traders will be watching for any reinforcement of that message from Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer when they speak later on Friday.Spot gold was down 0.5% at $1,228.05 an ounce by 2.30pm GMT, while US gold futures for April delivery were down $4.50 at $1,228.40.Gold prices have retreated sharply since failing to decisively break through resistance at their 200-day moving average of $1,261 this week."The market has responded very clearly to the more aggressive stance by FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) members regarding rate hikes in March," Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said. "It&rsquo;s fair to say that a rate hike in March is pretty much priced into gold."Gold is highly sensitive to rising US interest rates as they increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.The world&rsquo;s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Shares, reported a second daily inflow on Thursday, of 1.8 tonnes, bringing the weekly rise to four tonnes.The dollar took a breather after two days of gains on Friday but remained supported by growing expectations that the Fed will lift interest rates when it meets on March 14-15."With Federal Reserve president Yellen on the wires tonight, we look to see further weakness across the precious complex should she, as expected, promote the potential for an interest rate increase in March," MKS precious metals trader Sam Laughlin said in a note on Friday."Initial support for gold sits around $1,230, while below this we look to the 100-day moving average at $1,210."Among other precious metals, silver was down 0.1% at $17.73 after falling 3.5% on Thursday, its biggest one-day drop in 11 weeks. It is set to end the week 3.4% lower. Palladium was 1.3% lower at $757.55. Platinum, however, bucked the trend, recovering from the previous session&rsquo;s slide to a $978.75 one-month low to trade at $987.90 an ounce, up 0.3%.Reuters

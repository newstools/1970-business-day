New York The euro hit a one-year high against the dollar on Wednesday and German 10-year Bund yields continued to rise after doubling the previous day, on bets that Europe s and Britain s central banks are preparing to scale back economic stimulus.The dollar index slid as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said a debate on the need to raise interest rates is due "in the coming months," adding to a hawkish tone out of the European Central Bank on Tuesday.Carney s remarks convinced traders that European monetary policy was shifting in a more hawkish direction, analysts said.The monetary policy comments out of Europe and Britain come as the US Senate delayed a healthcare legislation vote, a move seen as pushing back the timeline for other items of President Donald Trump s agenda including a tax overhaul regarded as essential to support lofty stock valuations on Wall Street."Prospects for infrastructure spending and tax reform are fading by the minute" after the delayed healthcare vote, said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.US economic data released on Wednesday showed contracts to buy previously owned homes unexpectedly fell in May, the third straight monthly decline, while mortgage applications fell the most in six months last week.US stocks recovered most of their broad losses from the previous session, however. Bank stocks led the way, supported by a steeper Treasury yield curve.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 159.1 points, or 0.75%, to 21,469.76, the S&amp;P 500 gained 19.53 points, or 0.81%, to 2,438.91 and the Nasdaq Composite added 56.44 points, or 0.92%, to 6,203.07.The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.01% while MSCI s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.58%. Emerging market stocks lost 0.49%. MSCI s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.29% lower, while Japan s Nikkei lost 0.47%. Analysts said comments by ECB President Mario Draghi on Tuesday continued to support the euro even as sources said on Wednesday that he had intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not imminent policy tightening."There is a bigger story here that has to do with the repricing in general of monetary policy expectations," said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in New York."There is a bit of a concern in the markets about the fact that the balance of monetary policy expectations is moving a little bit in a more hawkish direction in Europe, and you ve seen that with the BOE, you ve seen that with the ECB."

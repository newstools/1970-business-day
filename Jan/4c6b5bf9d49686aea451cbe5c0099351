London Palladium leapt more than 7% on Friday to its highest in over 16 years, as a surge in speculative demand forced industrial users to close out short positions, traders said, pushing the metal through long-term chart resistance.The backwardation in the market a formation in the forward curve in which the price of metal for future delivery is below the spot price can suggest a near-term shortage of metal and has recently steepened, prompting a wave of buying. That pushed prices through the 16-year declining trendline at $868 an ounce, triggering a further surge that took them to their highest since early 2001 at $914.70 an ounce.Spot palladium was at $884.60 an ounce at 1.45pm GMT, up 3.7%."The background for palladium is for good industrial demand and likely a significant market deficit this year, and on top of course you ve got this speculative squeeze," said Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler."The backwardation has got a lot steeper in the last day. Metal for immediate delivery is very tight, and that is being reflected in those forward rates moving into an even steeper backwardation."Traders reported a reluctance to lend the metal, suggesting tightness in near-term supply. Chart patterns indicate that the metal is vulnerable to a sell-off from these elevated levels, however, technical analysts said.Gold fell for a third day, meanwhile, after British elections failed to deliver a clear majority for Prime Minister Theresa May, knocking the pound sharply lower and helping lift the dollar index to its highest since late May.Spot gold was down 1% at $1,265.91 an ounce, while US gold futures for August delivery were $10.90 an ounce lower at $1,268.60.Sterling-denominated gold rose to a near two-month high of 1,007.98 pounds an ounce as the British currency fell as much as 2.5%. Along with a drop in the euro, that helped lift the dollar half a% versus a currency basket.Meanwhile, the FTSE share index, composed largely of companies that earn foreign currencies and benefit from a weaker pound, rose 0.5%, undermining potential demand for gold as a haven from risk."A lot of the financial markets haven t moved as much as you might have thought," said Oxford Economics analyst Daniel Smith."The dollar s a little bit stronger, and that s going to weigh on gold," he said. "It s not just about risk appetite, it s about what people are thinking on the dollar."Among other precious metals, silver was down 0.8% to $17.23 an ounce, while platinum was 0.6% higher at $938.80.Reuters

The JSE weakened at the close on Wednesday as banks rallied and platinums retreated on a strong recovery in the rand against the dollar. Trading was choppy for most of the day, with the all share still up 0.65% at midday, hitting the 54,000-point level for the first time since June 2016, before weakening in the afternoon.The rand firmed nearly 2% against the dollar on the day in the local currency s strongest performance since last week s double downgrading to junk status by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.Retail and property stocks also firmed with the rand, with industrials mixed as the rand hedges came under pressure. The unit found support from the huge turnout from the march by opposition parties in Pretoria ahead of a vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma in Parliament later this month."Political parties and civil society continue to organise against the current leadership as we lose faith in its ability to deliver meaningful transformation for the majority of South Africans as it continues to favour a select few," said TreasuryOne dealer Phillip Pearce.The market shrugged off disappointing retail sales data. February s retail trade sales, which contracted by an annual 1.7% from 2.3% in January, provided further support for the view that the economy had entered a technical recession, said First National Bank economist Jason Muscat.He also said the retail trade sector would contract meaningfully from GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017. Two consecutive quarters of contraction is officially a recession. The weak retail data follows Tuesday s lower manufacturing numbers, indicating that manufacturing production fell by a worse-than-expected 3.6% in February.The JSE was also under pressure from weaker global markets, with the Dow Jones softening 0.29% at the JSE s close.

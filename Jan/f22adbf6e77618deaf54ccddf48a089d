After being under pressure for most of the shortened trading week and due to falling commodity prices, the JSE bounced back to end in positive territory on Friday as resources rebounded.Retailers, however, were sharply weaker in risk-off trade following the hawkish US Federal Reserve statement on interest rates, while property stocks also softened. Banks and financials closed lower.Falling commodity prices kept the all share under pressure for most of the week, but the market weakness might have been overdone.

Some comeback in the rand dampened sentiment on the JSE toward the close, but rand hedges remained strong.Oanda analyst Craig Erlam described the payrolls data as mixed: "But it will likely do nothing to either encourage or deter the US Federal Reserve when it comes to deciding whether to raise interest rates next month."The Dow Jones was weaker at the JSE s close (-0.19%).

Eskom has admitted it lied when it defended making payments totalling R1.6bn to Gupta linked financial advisory firm Trillian and global consultancy McKinsey.In June Eskom strongly defended the payments in response to questions posed by Business Day following the release of a damning report into Trillian by advocate Geoff Budlender.At the time Eskom said another global management consultancy, Oliver Wyman, had conducted an external review and concluded that all payments were based on prudent costs incurred and value created .&nbsp;But on Monday Eskom made an about-turn and conceded this information was false.Not only had Oliver Wyman failed to approve the payments it had red-flagged them and recommended a legal review of the entire contracting process.A correction sent from Eskom head of legal Suzanne Daniels pointed out that Oliver Wyman had been appointed to perform a technical peer-to-peer assessment of the work conducted by McKinsey and Trillian for Eskom . Oliver Wyman did not approve the making of any payment claims to McKinsey and Trillian, said Daniels. Oliver Wyman raised concerns with certain of the payment claims on procedural and technical grounds, and raised issues as to whether the payment claims represented fair value for work done. She said Oliver Wyman, which was founded in New York and has offices throughout the world, also recommended a separate process of reviewing Eskom s master service agreement with McKinsey and the contracting process of the overall programme.It is unclear at this stage which Eskom official provided its news desk with the false information.Last week Business Day reported that an investigation commissioned by Eskom s assurance and forensics division recommended suspending acting head of group capital Prish Govender, former head of procurement Edwin Mabelane and senior procurement manager Charles Kalima for their role in the payments to Trillian.They were suspended last Monday but reinstated two days later under dubious circumstances allegedly at the behest of Eskom chairman Zethembe Khoza, although he denies this.The investigation also recommended laying fraud and money laundering charges against Trillian for allegedly misrepresenting itself as a supplier development and black empowerment partner to McKinsey.It said a criminal probe should establish whether Govender, Mabelane, Kalima and Eskom s chief financial officer Anoj Singh should be held criminally liable for paying Trillian R600m without a contract.At the time Trillian was majority owned by close Gupta business associate Salim Essa. A report by former public protector Thuli Madonsela also said Trillian had funnelled money to the Guptas to buy Optimum coal mine, although Trillian denies this.Eskom has confirmed that its assurance and forensics division launched the investigation following an anonymous tip-off, without providing details.Singh said he wasn t aware of the investigation, and Govender, Mabelane and Kalima declined to comment.Trillian has denied any wrongdoing. It insists it billed only for work done and that it &nbsp; made no fraudulent representations in regard to McKinsey and Eskom, and both McKinsey and Eskom are fully aware to the relationship between the parties .McKinsey said it had partnered with Trillian on a five-month contract from September 2015 to work on Eskom s corporate plan.Subsequent to this McKinsey had held discussions with Trillian to be its supplier development partner on Eskom s turnaround plan but it had never materialised after Trillian failed a due diligence.McKinsey said it had informed Eskom in March 2016 that it had ended its relationship with Trillian. McKinsey presumes&nbsp;any payments from Eskom to Trillian after March 2016&nbsp;were governed by Eskom s rules and processes for approval of third party payments, said McKinsey spokesman Steve John.

Motor industry officials have suspended new-vehicle sales forecasts until the effect on the economy of President Jacob Zuma s Cabinet reshuffle, particularly the sacking of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, becomes clear.Figures released on Monday by the Department of Trade and Industry showed that new-vehicle sales grew 2.1% in March, compared to a year earlier. The industry sold 48,514 new vehicles in March, up from 47,514 in March 2016.New-car sales also improved 2.1%, from 30,390 to 31,034. Sales of commercial vehicles were particularly promising. Light commercials, mainly pick-ups, rose 1.1%, medium commercials 11.2%, heavies 4.8% and extra-heavies 27.7%.The upshot was that sales of all new vehicles for the first quarter of 2017 rose 1.9% from a year earlier, from 144,172 to 146,951. Car sales were up 0.9%, from 98,377 to 99,228.However, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of SA (Naamsa), which represents not only local producers but also importers, said Zuma s actions had created market uncertainty. Vehicle sales trends were closely aligned to the country s overall economic performance particularly GDP growth, exchange rates and the direction of interest rates.The association said: "In light of the political events, Naamsa will suspend, for the time being, projections for domestic vehicle sales. Once the situation and conditions have settled down and greater clarity is forthcoming as to the impact of the political events on the direction of the economy, we will resume and offer guidance on expected new-vehicle sales trends."It added that in both the short-and medium-term, the potential effect of current events on vehicle sales were "significantly on the downside". However, lack of clarity on future policy meant "Naamsa is unable to provide any meaningful projections at this stage".Nicholas Nkosi, head of Standard Bank s vehicle and asset finance retail activities, said it was difficult to predict sales with certainty in the light of the last few days. "It makes forecasting a lot more difficult. None of us can be sure what is going to happen with the economy."Vehicle exports were strong in March, growing 7.8% compared to a year earlier, from 27,720 to 29,879. As a result, total exports in the first quarter of 2017 improved by 1.9%, from 70,044 to 70,683.

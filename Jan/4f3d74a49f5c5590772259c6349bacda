The company responsible for the controversial Shongweni landfill site west of Durban says it is "considering its options" after the Department of Environmental Affairs ordered it to shut down.On Tuesday the department suspended EnviroServ s waste management licence for the site giving the company until Friday to cease operations. Residents of nearby suburbs in the Outer West area of the eThekwini municipality have blamed the facility for a "noxious" smell."There is still an unacceptably high level of landfill gases being emitted from the Shongweni landfill site which the authorities have confirmed to be the source of the malodour emanating from the site. The decision to suspend the waste management licence is therefore one of the significant steps to a permanent solution to this catastrophic situation " the department said.But EnviroServ CEO Dean Thompson said the company was likely to head to the courts to appeal against the decision."The department has, this week, issued the Shongweni landfill site with a notice of suspension of its waste management licence. Our legal experts are currently considering this notice and will act in due course. The provisional advice is that an appeal will be filed against this directive as we believe that not all relevant information has been properly considered " he said.Thompson added that just last week the company shared air quality data with the department from monitors installed in affected communities."These monitors revealed the presence of high levels of sulphur dioxide a harmful gas with a pungent odour a gas typically produced by combustion processes and which does not emanate from landfill sites. This to our knowledge has yet to be followed up by the authorities," Thompson said.."Our remediation plans as agreed-upon with the Department of Environmental Affairs remain on track to mitigate our diminishing contribution to the existing odour problem in the coming months " he said.TMG Digital

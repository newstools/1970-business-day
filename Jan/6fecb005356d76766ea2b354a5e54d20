About R6bn the SABC spent but could not account for was one of the reasons it was in trouble with Parliament&rsquo;s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) on Wednesday.Another was its last-minute submission of crucial documents.The SABC, which continues to hog the headlines for all the wrong reasons, appeared before Parliament&rsquo;s finance watchdog on Wednesday to explain how it incurred irregular expenditure amounting to R5.1bn, and fruitless and wasteful expenditure totalling R92m.MPs were unhappy after the public broadcaster submitted documents detailing its finances just a day before the meeting.The public broadcaster&rsquo;s executives, led by acting CEO James Aguma, were time and again blasted by MPs who said the SABC seemed not to care about "the public&rsquo;s money"."We should take SABC as a special case and have an in-loco inspection [at the SABC offices] &hellip; this speaks to the issue of document management at the SABC," Inkatha Freedom Party MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa said."The SABC must not live in an ivory tower &hellip; as if its finances are the exclusive domain of the leadership," he said, adding that as a TV licence payer, he expected every rand to be taken seriously.Said the ANC&rsquo;s Mnyami Booi: "Let&rsquo;s sit on their necks until [they account] for the R5.1bn."Aguma seemed to blame the irregular expenditure on previous executives, saying the problems dated back to 2008, and mainly related to breaches of regulations on supply chain management.The public broadcaster was implementing new mechanisms to address the issues raised by the auditor-general, he said. An investigation of the irregular expenditure would be completed in April.In 2016, the auditor-general flagged the irregular expenditure of R5.1bn, "identified in the current and previous year", and highlighted that this had not been investigated to determine whether a person was liable for the expenditure.The auditor-general&rsquo;s report revealed that the SABC had awarded 71 contracts worth R150.7m to "close family members, partners and associates of officials".On Tuesday, the public broadcaster appeared before Parliament&rsquo;s communications portfolio committee to discuss its annual report, which showed a loss of R411m in the 2015-16 financial year, up from R395m the previous year.The SABC looks set for another loss in the current financial year, after recording a net loss of R256m for the second quarter (July-September 2016).Scopa requested written reports from the SABC on a number of issues related to procurement and human resources matters to be submitted by next week Wednesday.Scopa MPs are also considering visiting SABC offices to conduct an in-loco inspection to further interrogate some of the issues affecting the broadcaster.

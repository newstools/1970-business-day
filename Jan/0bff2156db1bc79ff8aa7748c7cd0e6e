Oakbay Investments is arguing that the declaratory order sought by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan against the Gupta-linked company is too narrow and will apply only to this case.This was one of the reasons given for why the High Court in Pretoria should dismiss Gordhan&rsquo;s application for a declaratory order stating that he cannot intervene in the relationship between the banks and their clients.Cedric Puckrin SC, for Oakbay Investments, questioned who the order would be binding on."The relief sought is so narrow&hellip;. It will have no effect and will not stop Oakbay or anyone else petitioning for help in the future," he said.Oakbay conceded that Gordhan could not intervene but Puckrin said he would not concede that the order would be binding on anyone in the future.He also said his client had never said Gordhan was obliged to intervene.The country s four banks are supporting Gordhan s application and believe the court needs to give clarity on what the minister s powers are.Vincent Maleka SC, for Standard Bank which wanted an extended declaratory order that neither the president nor any other minister can intervene argued that if Gordhan did not have the power to intervene, no other minister should.Maleka took aim at Oakbay s behaviour, saying it was the pressure put on the executive to intervene that had caused concern and necessitated the order.He said the order sought would not have impeded the work of the executive.The banks wanted clarity on the limits of both public and private power.The case is continuing.

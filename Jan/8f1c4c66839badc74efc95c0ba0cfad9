Lobby group the Organisation for Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) on Monday said it is instituting legal action against South African Airways (SAA) chair Dudu Myeni, in a bid to have her declared a delinquent director.Outa intended to send a clear message that the failure to uphold fiduciary duties had consequences, and would be seeking to prevent Myeni from continuing to serve in any other boards or organisations, Outa chairman Wayne Duvenage said on Monday."We further believe it is essential to take this legal action against Ms Myeni, and others in similar positions of standing, when appropriate, in order to hold her accountable for her conduct and transgressions," Duvenage said.In 2016 Outa took SAA to court and successfully halted a deal with "boutique" financier BnP capital to restructure R15bn worth of the airline&rsquo;s debt. BnP and SAA ultimately cancelled the deal.Duvenage said on Monday the new legal challenge was one of a number of forthcoming challenges against what it saw as an abuse of position in entities. "Too much is happening and very little happens about it. We need to go down this [legal route]," he said."We have enough facts to say what Myeni is doing at SAA," he said.

The Reserve Bank left interest rates unchanged on Thursday, at its second meeting of 2017, which took place amid heightened political turmoil.At the January meeting, the Bank signalled that it could begin raising rates again if higher oil prices or a weaker rand caused inflation to remain outside the Bank&rsquo;s 3%-6% target range.Consumer inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) spent most of last year above 6%, and the most recent reading, for February, showed CPI inflation slowing to 6.3% from 6.6% in January, with food inflation down to 9.9% after being in double digits since April last year.Food inflation is expected to continue falling as a severe drought abates in many areas of SA. Farmers are anticipating the second-biggest maize crop on record and a resumption of exports.Oil prices have fallen and the rand had enjoyed a strong run of late, setting up a fuel price cut of an estimated 62c-64c a litre next Wednesday.However, the rand weakened sharply after President Jacob Zuma called Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, back from their international investor roadshow on Monday, leading to fear that the fight for control of Treasury was entering the endgame.Announcing the Bank s decision, governor Lesetja Kganyago said steady oil prices and an improved inflation outlook informed the decision. He did, however, say political uncertainty was a risk to the rand exchange rate and thus inflation.The Bank now expects CPI inflation to average 5.9% year on year in 2017, from its 6.2% forecast in January; and to slow to 5.4% in 2018, against the January outlook of 5.5%. It expects an average of 5.5% in 2019.In January, the Bank said it expected that inflation had peaked at 6.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016, and should return to within the target band in the second quarter of 2017. It now expects inflation to peak at 6.4% in the first quarter of 2017, returning to the target band in the second quarter.Core inflation, which measures inflation excluding energy and food prices, is expected to average 5.4% in 2017 and 5.2% in 2018.On the economy s prospects, the Bank expects gross domestic product (GDP) growth to average: 1.2% in 2017 (January forecast: 0.4%), 1.7% in 2018 (January forecast: 1.1%) and 2% in 2019.Thursday s decision left the repo rate unchanged at 7%. The Bank has raised rates by 75 basis points since the start of 2015, and by 200 basis points since January 2014. The last rate increase was 25 basis points in March 2016, and followed a 50-point rise in January 2016.

Municipalities were owed R117.7bn at the end of December by organs of state, business, private households and other entities, Treasury chief director of local government budget analysis Jan Hattingh said on Friday.Hattingh gave an update of the municipal debt situation to a joint meeting of Parliament&rsquo;s standing and select committees on appropriations. He said debt by government entities represented R6.3bn (5.3%) of the R117.7bn owed to municipalities, businesses R25.2bn (21.4%), households R77.9bn (66.2%), and other entities R8.3bn.Treasury was also very concerned about the R34.3bn which municipalities owed to creditors, an increase of about R6bn over the year.The biggest debt is to Eskom at just below R10bn. However, the issue is being addressed at the highest level of government through an inter-ministerial committee. "We are very optimistic that we are going to gradually make progress," said Hattingh, adding that Eskom had indicated a willingness to change its practices.Early this year, the utility gave notice to cut off power to defaulting municipalities, mostly in the North West and Mpumalanga. Treasury, he said, was working on a large scale programme to help municipalities deal with their revenue challenge, as well as with their water and electricity losses.It was a long-term project which would involve re-instituting best practices that had been allowed to slide, as well as capacitating municipalities.

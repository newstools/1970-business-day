POLICE Minister Nathi Nhleko refused to work with Robert McBride on Wednesday, saying their employment relationship had irretrievably broken down, as the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) executive director returned to his desk after an acrimonious suspension.In a statement the minister said he was not prepared to work with McBride after remarks he made about the minister during his suspension and over the misconduct allegations behind his suspension. &nbsp;Their employment relationship had "irretrievably broken down".The statement said McBride&rsquo;s suspension was based on allegations that he tampered with a report that recommended criminal charges against former Hawks leaders allegedly implicated in an illegal extradition process of four Zimbabweans.This comes a month after the Constitutional Court ruled McBride&rsquo;s suspension was unlawful and determined that Parliament would be given 30 days to decide on the matter.Nhleko then raced to have Parliament initiate a disciplinary process against McBride, empowering the minister to suspend him again. However, National Assembly Speaker Baleka &nbsp;Mbete said the&nbsp;next National Assembly sitting was due on October 25 and that only the house had the authority to make the determination.Police portfolio committee chairman Francois Beukman agreed and the matter fell away during a committee meeting on Tuesday. McBride returned to work on Wednesday.The statement said he asked McBride to seek clarity from Mbete on how to conduct his work "under the prevailing circumstances" now that his suspension was over.&nbsp;

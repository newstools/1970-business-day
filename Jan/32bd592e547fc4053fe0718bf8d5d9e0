The JSE maintained its recent momentum on Wednesday with gold and platinum stocks making good gains while the rand strengthened ahead of crucial manufacturing and mining data on Thursday.Statistics SA will release mining and manufacturing data for March on Thursday, which could well have an effect on markets.Investec economist Kamilla Kaplan expected manufacturing production for March to show a slight 0.1% year-on-year improvement compared with the 3.6% contraction in February. Mining is forecast to make a positive contribution to first-quarter GDP."This would serve to offset some of the likely drag from the manufacturing and retail sectors. The lift in commodity prices and the ongoing strengthening in global growth indicators have aided the performance of the mining sector," Kaplan said.The JSE closed 0.15% higher at 54,254.30 points and the blue-chip top 40 added 0.16%.

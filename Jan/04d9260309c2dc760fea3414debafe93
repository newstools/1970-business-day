ANC Youth League President Collen Maine will face a hate speech complaint against him at the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) over his comments about Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan at the weekend.Maine described Gordhan as an "impimpi" (a spy), adding that "something had to be done about" him at the youth league&rsquo;s KwaZulu-Natal conference at the weekend, in President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s presence.Civil society has raised concern about describing Gordhan as an "impimpi" as the term is associated with assassinations, necklacing and other violent acts during the liberation struggle and the fight against apartheid.Johannesburg Against Injustice (JAI) &mdash; whose members are political, civic and youth activists from the 1970s and 1980s &mdash; said on Wednesday that it was consulting its legal team to lay a hate speech complaint against Maine with the SAHRC.It plans to finalise the complaint in the next 48 hours."It is wholly unacceptable that people resort to character assassination and incitement to violence to settle political scores, two decades into our democracy &mdash; more especially when the score seemingly relates to ambitions by some to plunder the national purse and line the pockets of a parasitic elite," JAI said on Wednesday.The JAI called on Zuma to publicly distance himself from Maine&rsquo;s comments and to ensure Gordhan and his family are "physically secure"."We demand that Collen Maine publicly retract the impimpi label and that he be called to account to the ANC. The ANC cannot continue to allow a sitting minister, appointed by the President, to be defamed. Has the ANC not learnt from its previous experiences with uncontrollable ANC Youth League presidents that brought disrepute to the party?" the group said.The Activist Citizen&rsquo;s Movement, a KwaZulu-Natal-based civic organisation consisting of both current and former activists and members of the ANC, has lodged a complaint against Maine with the ANC&rsquo;s integrity committee.It has called on the ANC to discipline Maine."Maine clearly incited the audience to commit acts of violence against the minister and, in particular, to engage in the act of &lsquo;necklacing&rsquo;," it said."Not only are these statements by Maine liable to civil and criminal sanction, but they are also a violation of several sections of the constitution of the ANC."The integrity committee could not immediately confirm receipt of the complaint, but it is meeting this weekend and will be able to comment early next week.Maine could not immediately be reached for comment.

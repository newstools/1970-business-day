MTN Group, Africa&rsquo;s biggest mobile phone operator, said on Tuesday that Mteto Nyati, CE of its South African unit, would resign on March 13 and be replaced by Godfrey Motsa on the same day.Motsa is a vice-president of the South and East Africa region of MTN Group, and has more than 10 years of experience in the mobile telecoms industry.He was previously CEO of Vodacom in Lesotho and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and more recently chief officer consumer business unit at Vodacom SA.MTN Group reported a $108m annual loss last week, its first in two decades, after it was hit by a regulatory fine in Nigeria and unfavourable currency moves.MTN agreed to pay a $1.1bn fine, reduced from $5.2bn last June after a long legal battle to end a dispute in Nigeria over missing a deadline to cut off unregistered SIM cards.Reuters

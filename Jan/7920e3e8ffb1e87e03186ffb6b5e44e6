Emboldened by the apparent ructions within the ANC and its alliance partners, the DA wasted little time on Thursday announcing that it would table yet another motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma, once Parliament was back in session.DA leader Mmusi Maimane said that the party had taken the decision to table the motion following Zuma s now confirmed intention to fire Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, and Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas.The EFF has confirmed that it would support the motion.Zuma is under pressure amid reports that some of his ministers, and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, are considering resigning should he follow through on his plan to sack Gordhan and replace him with former Eskom CEO, and now ANC MP, Brian Molefe. Molefe quit Eskom following a report by then public protector Thuli Madonsela in which he was accused of favouring the Gupta family, which is in business with Zuma s son, in coal supply contracts.There is speculation that some ANC MPs might support the DA s latest motion of no confidence in Zuma, which could spell the end of his presidency.Previous motions of no confidence brought by the opposition have been stifled by the ruling ANC, which enjoys a majority in Parliament with 249 of the 400 National Assembly seats. In November, the ANC used its Parliamentary majority to quash the DA s attempt have Zuma removed from office. The opposition party had brought the motion after Madonsela recommended that the President establish a commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture by the influential Gupta family.On Thursday, Maimane said that Zuma continued to play Russian Roulette with the economy and the future of the country, at a time when 9-million South Africans are without work."Since his reckless and irrational decision to recall Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, from an international roadshow to boost investment, growth and job creation in SA, the gains made by Gordhan and Jonas to restore credibility in our economy following the disastrous firing of former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene 15 months ago, have all but been eviscerated," said Maimane.He said Zuma had threatened the economy by dangling the possibility of firing Gordhan and Jonas before the country, and before the world, "by using a bizarre and seemingly last-minute security report to justify such removals"."This is nothing more than an attempt at total state capture, and cannot be accepted. The President s actions confirm what we already know: Zuma has abandoned the interests of the people, the economy and SA in favour of a kleptocratic Guptamocracy, where the keys to the Treasury and the government are made available to anyone who puts Zuma first and the people last. The Treasury stands as the last line of defence against Zuma and his project of state capture and unfettered looting," Maimane said."Parliament hired Jacob Zuma, and Parliament must now fire Jacob Zuma. Only Parliament can act now the courts do not have the authority to remove a sitting president."Parliament goes into recess this week until the beginning of May.

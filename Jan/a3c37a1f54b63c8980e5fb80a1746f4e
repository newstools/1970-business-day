The ANC told the government that it should rescind a decision to reappoint Brian Molefe as Eskom CEO, the ruling party s secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said.ANC officials told the government of their position at a meeting on Monday attended by President Jacob Zuma, Mantashe said by phone from Johannesburg.The ANC previously condemned the reappointment of Molefe, who resigned as head of Eskom in November after a graft probe questioned his conduct."They should look into that; ideally they should reverse that decision," Mantashe said on Tuesday. "We are hoping that they are starting on it immediately."In a report in 2016, former public protector Thuli Madonsela found that Molefe favoured the Gupta family, which is in business with Zuma s son, by awarding coal-supply contracts and helping them buy Optimum Coal. He and Eskom denied wrongdoing, with Molefe crying during a November 3 briefing.Bloomberg

Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza has dismissed payment agreements between two of his province&rsquo;s municipalities and power utility Eskom which are aimed at preventing the councils from facing scheduled power interruptions.The two municipalities, Emalahleni and Msukaligwa local municipalities are among 14 municipalities which face the risk of scheduled interruptions due to their failure to pay Eskom for electricity.The matter has continued on for over a year with councils repeatedly defaulting on their obligation to pay the strained utility. Emalahleni and Msukaligwa currently owe Eskom more than R1.2bn combined.However, Mabuza, during a government meeting in Mpumalanga where Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen was also present, said the payment plans the two municipalities entered into were unsustainable as the councils were repeat defaulters."Just before they went to the councils after the elections, I spoke to them about this, and four months down the line we are here. I don&rsquo;t know why I should keep certain people in their jobs because someone didn&rsquo;t do his or her job. This quick-fix thing won&rsquo;t help; our municipalities do not have the capacity to sell electricity and to collect revenue," said Mabuza.Part of the payment plan was that the councils would be allowed to leverage their equitable share allocations to clear the debt in small portions. Mabuza said this was out of the question, as equitable share was used to deliver services to people, not to clear rolling debt."We want something tangible so that when we turn our backs, we should not hear anything from the two municipalities that would cause headache for all of us," he said.Mabuza ordered the councils back to the drawing board and asked that they meet Eskom in a week&rsquo;s time with a solid payment plan. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe told Business Day that Eskom&rsquo;s negotiations with the two municipalities were still ongoing."I&rsquo;m not sure about the reasons, but from our side there are a number of suggestions we have rejected because the municipalities are repeat offenders. I am not surprised that the premier is concerned because many of these councils are not sustainable," said Phasiwe.Phasiwe said the municipalities had until Friday to develop solid payment agreements and a payment plan, or schedule cut-offs of electricity would commence in the two municipalities starting on Saturday.

The JSE closed flat on Monday as resources were held back by the stronger rand, while general retailers and property stocks found favour.The rand gained against the dollar already weakened by US nonfarm-payroll data after S&amp;P Global Ratings kept SA s junk status unchanged on Friday. The outlook is negative.The focus is now on the imminent ratings decision by Moody s, which is expected to downgrade SA s credit rating one notch, with a negative outlook. Its review is due on June 9.Trading was cautious for most of the day ahead of GDP data for the first quarter, set to be released on Tuesday, with flat growth expected.Old Mutual Investment Group chief economist Rian le Roux said the danger was that SA might still be subjected to further ratings downgrades. "In a worst-case scenario ,it might even be a full-scale ratings meltdown, characterised by multiple downgrades by all the agencies," he said.Le Roux expected Moody s to downgrade the foreign and local currency ratings by one notch, which keeps them at investment grade.This means Moody s will have the same rating as S&amp;P Global Ratings. "It provided SA with another brief reprieve to get its economic house in order, but it will be short, as the two agencies will revisit SA s ratings within six months," Le Roux said.The Dow Jones opened flat and European markets trended weaker amid negative sentiment following the weekend s terror attack in London, in which seven people were killed and three attackers shot dead.The FTSE 100 softened 0.15% and the French CAC dropped 0.51%.Platinum recovered in late trade amid a generally negative environment for miners.

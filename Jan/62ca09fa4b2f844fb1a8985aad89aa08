London Gold was steady on Tuesday after hitting a five-month peak the previous session, bolstered by a softer dollar, North Korea tensions and nervousness ahead of the French presidential election.The dollar index fell near a three-week low on disappointing US housing starts data and nerves over trade talks between the US and Japan, while Britain s pound soared after Prime Minister Theresa May called for a snap general election.May s call added to a lengthening list of uncertainties for investors already on edge over geopolitical tensions that also include Syria, Afghanistan, Turkey and US relations with Russia and China."Short-term risk is skewed to the downside but underlying support is there with the focus on political uncertainties. We see the yen continuing to strengthen, and a strong yen and strong gold have gone hand-in-hand since November," Saxo Bank s head of commodity strategy Ole Hansen said.

It s not a good sign when your country s leader is listed with Donald Trump whose approval rating hovers near 40%.President Jacob Zuma was bestowed that dubious honour recently when Time Magazine compiled a list of five world leaders less popular with their citizens than the embattled American president.South Africans with a penchant for dark comedy will be heartened to see Zuma making the cut with Time pegging his approval rating "at an all-time low of 20%" in the seven major metropolitan areas. More eye-popping is the number of South Africans who want him to resign: an astounding 70%.While the article lists the country s slumping economy as part of the reason for the low approval ratings it blames the president too."But it s Zuma himself who s the bigger problem " the article reads listing the nearly 800 charges of corruption against him his patronage networks and the expulsion of well-respected ministers as among the myriad reasons that only one in five urban South Africans supports the president."Zuma s term runs through 2019 for most South Africans change can t come soon enough " the article concludes.The other four listed include Michele Temer of Brazil Venezuela s Nicolas Maduro Najib Razak of Malaysia and Alexis Tsipras of Greece.South Africans might be comforted that at least Zuma has not overseen crises on the scale of some of the above leaders: Maduro endures daily violent protests and inflation that reached more than 800% last year, and has defanged the national legislature.Temer may find himself the second Brazilian president in a row to be impeached after recordings emerged linking him to the far-reaching Lavo Jato graft scandal.Brazil is also in its worst recession after two consecutive years of the economy contracting more than 7%.TMG Digital

London &#8212; Gold steadied just above $1,250 an ounce on Wednesday, taking a breather after the previous day&#8217;s fall as investors awaited minutes of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s latest meeting for clues on the outlook for US interest rates.The metal is highly sensitive to rising US rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced. Spot gold XAU= was at $1,251.83 an ounce at 13:30 GMT, little changed from $1,250.76 late on Tuesday, when it slipped 0.7 percent after two days of gains.The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee&#8217;s early May meeting are due to be released at 18:00 GMT. Interest rate futures on Tuesday implied traders saw about an 83 percent chance of a rate increase in June, up from 79% on Monday.&quot;(We&#8217;re in) wait and see mode ahead of the FOMC minutes later today and the OPEC meeting tomorrow,&quot; Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said, adding that the Fed is likely to signal further gradual rate hikes.Expectations for US interest rates to rise next month and potentially again later in the year have been a major factor in keeping gold prices pinned below chart resistance at $1,300 an ounce this year.Gold has risen 3% since hitting a near-two month low of $1,213.81 on May 9, driven chiefly by political turmoil in the United States after President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey, which prompted a drop in stock markets and put the dollar under pressure. &quot;While the selling appetite seems to be fading following four weeks of long liquidation, (gold) still needs a catalyst to break higher,&quot; Saxo Bank&#8217;s head of commodity research Ole Hansen said.&quot;At this stage the risk-reward seems skewed to the upside, but with the multi-year downtrend lurking just above I see muted fund interest until a potential break has been realised.&quot; World stock markets eased on Wednesday after China&#8217;s sovereign credit rating was downgraded and as investors eyed a pause in Wall Street&#8217;s four-day winning streak, the longest in over three months. The dollar was little changed against a currency basket.

It is easy to get lost in the complex terminology of social-grants payments and the complex mechanics of getting R142bn a year from state coffers to beneficiaries.Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), a subsidiary of JSE-listed Net1, won the R10bn contract to perform this task from the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) in 2012, based largely on its ability to undertake biometric authentication of beneficiaries for enrolment and payment.This is how the process works, based mainly on last week&rsquo;s presentation to Parliament&rsquo;s social development committee by Tim Masela, head of the Reserve Bank&rsquo;s national payment system department:Beneficiaries get payments using a smart card that can operate in the national payment system.When Sassa and Net1 capture details and biometrics of beneficiaries on registration, a beneficiary opens a bank account with Grindrod Bank, which issues a debit card endorsed by MasterCard. The debit card has a pin and/or Net1 biometric capability.Sassa validates the beneficiary on its own database using the physical verification of a fingerprint and remote voice authentication.Masela said that for grants of R11bn monthly to be paid, Treasury releases funds into a Sassa account with Nedbank. The money is then transferred into a Net1 account and into Grindrod Bank beneficiary accounts. A small portion of the total grant payments is paid into other bank accounts.About 60% of all grant beneficiaries have access to banking infrastructure; the rest rely on cash paypoints using biometric verification for payments. About three to four million people use CPS cash paypoints.Beneficiaries can draw cash from their Grindrod bank accounts and ATMs of other banks, point of sale devices and through the CPS "closed loop" from retailers such as Shoprite which have adapted their systems for this.CPS is the only operator capable of undertaking biometric verification for enrolment and payment. That is why it won the contract in the first place. But this is controversial, and some, such as DA social development spokesman Bridget Masango, say that requirement was inserted after the tender process to ensure it won the contract.Masango also argues that this capability is not necessary, arguing that banks have other means of verifying clients.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini again insisted on the need for biometric verification during a media conference on Sunday, claiming it had saved billions.After CPS won the contract, one of the unsuccessful bidders, AllPay, successfully challenged the award in the Constitutional Court, which declared it invalid in April 2014 on the grounds of an irregular tender process.The court suspended the declaration of invalidity pending the issuance of a new tender by Sassa. The court said Sassa had to initiate a new tender process for the payment of social grants within 30 days of the order.If no new contract was issued, the suspension of invalidity of the CPS contract would continue until the completion of the five year term of the contract on March 31 2017.In a bid to fulfil Constitutional Court stipulations for a new tender process, Sassa issued a new tender and received three bids &mdash; from Durban Knight Investments, Vodacom and Standard Bank &mdash; but they did not meet the mandatory requirements set out in the tender.One of the key requirements of the tender was that the contractor use biometric verification of beneficiaries, and this eliminated two of the bidders. Standard Bank failed to meet the mandatory price set out in the tender.Sassa, on the advice of the bid adjudication committee decided, not to award the contract because of what it termed "nonresponsiveness" of all the bids in terms of administrative functionality and other requirements. The tender was then cancelled, and Sassa decided to focus on preparing for the takeover the payment of social grants when the CPS contract expired at end-March 2017.Sassa reported this outcome to the Constitutional Court and committed itself to seven deliverables in the preparation for the takeover. Sassa submitted a later report to the court on its progress in preparing for the takeover of the grants payment system.In November 2015, the court discharged itself of its supervisory role over the process.It now seems that Sassa and CPS have agreed that CPS will continue to pay grants for a further two years while Sassa establishes its alternative systems. Sassa, Treasury and the Reserve Bank agree on a medium-term plan, but not on the long term plan for payments.The medium-term plan is for payments to be made through the banking infrastructure. An external service provider will be brought in to service those who use the cash paypoints. Sassa will have limited involved in the payment system.

Afrimat, the rising star of the JSE s construction and engineering industry stocks and related cement and building materials shares, has launched its own construction index.Compiled by economist Roelof Botha on behalf of the company, the inaugural Afrimat Construction Index (ACI) was launched on Thursday, indicating a "relatively strong performance in construction activity since the third quarter of 2010" the base-year for the index."The third quarter of 2010 was exactly one year after the end of the 2008-09 recession and is regarded as a statistically representative base-period for a medium-term, time series-based index," Botha said.The ACI is derived from six different indicators: the building materials sales index; buildings completed within larger municipalities; building plans passed by larger municipalities; the FNB/BER building confidence index; the FNB/BER civil construction index; and retail trade sales of hardware, paint and glass.Retail hardware store sales have improved by more than 70% overall since the third quarter of 2010, while the sales of building materials and the value of building plans approved both improved by 24% over the past 25 quarters. "There is more activity in construction in SA than is generally recognised in other data sets," Botha said.Afrimat CEO, Andries van Heerden, said on Thursday, "What Afrimat is trying to do [with the index] is realistically look at the environment we are in."The group has benefited from government spending on roads and smaller water and sanitation projects over the past five years. These underpinned human habitation amid a move away from major infrastructure developments, including dams, railways and ports.When listed on the JSE in 2006, the company was mainly an aggregates producer, but also making some cement building products and ready-mixed cement. It has since become a strategic supplier of industrial minerals and iron ore.The group s share price has rocketed from about R2 in early 2009 to above R30 now. It now describes itself as an open-pit mining company providing industrial minerals and construction materials. In the 25 quarters since the base-period in 2010, the ACI shows activity in the construction industry had risen 28% up to the fourth quarter of 2016.By comparison, SA s real GDP expanded by a total 11.5% over the period. This clearly indicated relatively strong construction activity since the end of 2010 when compared with generalised economic activity in SA, Botha said.The index shows expansion in construction activity up to the first quarter of 2017 has been driven mainly by improved retail sales values for hardware, glass and paint. This comes on better demand for building materials and an up-tick in the number of residential building plans approved by the larger municipalities.However, provisional data obtained during the first three months of 2017 shows the likelihood of a marginal decline in construction levels after the first quarter, mainly due to weak values for building plans passed by larger municipalities. The downturn may reflect bureaucratic delays caused by governance changes after recent municipal elections.Botha said the composite nature of the index smoothed out contradictory trends of conditions in the construction sector that were often portrayed by the individual components within the index.

Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown has granted Eskom s board more time to come up with a new pension pay-out proposal for the parastatal s former group CEO Brian Molefe. This is after Brown, last week, rejected a R30m "golden handshake" for the former Eskom boss and instructed the electricity provider s board to report back with an appropriate pay-out proposal within seven days.She said she found the original proposal "lacking in legal rationale" and that it could not be substantiated as a performance reward. However on Wednesday, she said she had granted the Eskom board more time to resolve the pension pay-out issue "through a mutually beneficial consultation process"."The board has asked for more time to finalise its internal process and, in the interest of fairness I have acceded to it " Brown said. "The chairperson Dr Ben Ngubane, approached me this week and indicated that the process has started. However he requested an extension, which I have granted."Molefe was at the state-owned entity for 18 months.TMG Digital

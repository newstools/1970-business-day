The market is already pricing in an 80% probability of that happening.US nonfarm jobs rose 227,000 in January, which indicated a healthy US economy supportive of higher inflation in the months ahead. The US Federal Reserve has stated in the past it would then be ready to act by increasing rates.The consensus was for 175,000 jobs created in February, but markets were bracing themselves for a better number following improved jobs data in the US private sector released earlier in the week.Lower oil prices on Thursday set the scene for a retreat among commodity prices, with global mining houses that have exposure to iron ore particularly hard hit.

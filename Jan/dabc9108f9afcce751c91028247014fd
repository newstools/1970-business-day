On Thursday, Mzwanele Manyi, the president of controversial lobby group Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF), sought to clarify what he meant when he said the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment (Fica) Bill would "bankrupt" the ruling party. Manyi&rsquo;s statement, made earlier this year, prompted Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to distance the party from it on Wednesday.Speaking to journalists in Johannesburg on Thursday, Manyi claimed he and Ramaphosa were actually in agreement on the issue, but were speaking in different contexts &mdash; however, he did not go into detail about the context within which he was speaking when he made the comment."The deputy president is actually very correct in the context he was speaking, because he was speaking in the context which says if there is money laundering, if there is financing of terrorism, clearly the ANC doesn t want that," Manyi said. "As a member of the ANC, I wouldn t want myself to be part of the ANC which is a beneficiary of those types of nefarious activities. So the deputy president and I are at one on this one."During public hearings on the bill earlier this year Manyi said the legislation was an attempt to "bankrupt" the ANC before the next national elections in 2019, and said the bill would be used by detractors to embarrass and blacklist ANC donors "so when we get to 2019 the ANC is as broke as hell".On Wednesday, the EFF s Floyd Shivambu told Ramaphosa that Manyi's comments implied that "the ANC benefited from a lack of legislation to combat money laundering and financing of terrorist activities".Ramaphosa said he didn't know what Manyi was talking about: "The legislation will significantly strengthen our ability to track money laundering and money used to fund terrorism," he said. "The ANC does not rely on money filtered into the country by means of money laundering or financing of terrorist activities."President Jacob Zuma sent the bill back to Parliament six months after the legislature had passed it, citing concerns over the constitutionality of its provision for warrantless searches. This was after the PPF had lodged an objection over the bill s constitutionality.The National Assembly unanimously adopted the bill on Tuesday. Manyi said the organisation was studying the latest amendments and consulting its legal representatives.With Babalo Ndenze

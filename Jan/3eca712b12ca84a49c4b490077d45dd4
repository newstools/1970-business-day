Liberty Holdings has&nbsp;appointed a new CEO to replace Thabo Dloti, who is stepping aside over differences with the board."Thabo is leaving Liberty following a difference of opinion with the board on the immediate focus of the company at a timewhen the organisation is facing tough operational and environmental challenges," Liberty said in a Sens announcement on Tuesday morning.The change takes effect immediately.Dloti had been Liberty CEO&nbsp;for a little over three years.Taking the reins is David Munro,&nbsp; CEO of corporate and investment banking at Standard Bank."Thabo believes that given this environment, alignment amongst key stakeholders is imperative to ensure the effective execution of the strategy required to drive the company forward. This alignment coupled with the ability to act decisively is in the best interests of the company and hence Thabo is stepping aside," Liberty said.Standard Bank said in a separate Sens announcement that&nbsp;Kenny Fihla, the current deputy CEO and head of client coverage&nbsp;at the corporate and investment banking unit, would succeed Munro.Liberty shares were up 1.7% at R112.67 at lunchtime on Tuesday, and Standard Bank stock was trading a little more than 0.4% higher at R152.65.Standard Bank&nbsp;is the majority shareholder in Liberty, and the insurer's double-digit drop in full-year earnings delivered a roughly 6% hit to&nbsp;Standard Bank's earnings.

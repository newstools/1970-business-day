Nobel Laureate Prof Wole Soyinka is joining the decolonisation movement at the faculty of humanities at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) as a distinguished visiting professor. Soyinka is Africa&rsquo;s only black Nobel Laureate for literature and continues to actively teach and engage in public discourse on global politics and development.Students around the country have advocated for decolonisation in the Fees Must Fall protests, which were first sparked in 2015. Prof Tshilidzi Marwala, deputy vice-chancellor of research and internationalisation at UJ, says decolonisation entails changing the movement of knowledge from the developed world to the developing world and that the appointment spoke to this project of decolonising education in the country.He says having Soyinke at the university was a move that shows Africans could have their own literature, which has its own style and flavour: "Thereby, we can then export that literature to the rest of the world and reverse the direction of knowledge that has tended to come from outside due to our colonial history. It&rsquo;s a clear demonstration that, as Africans, we have capacity and something to give to the world."Marwala says Soyinka&rsquo;s achievements dispelled the myth that Africa was not a hub of knowledge production.UJ is one of the largest public universities in the country and, through Soyinka&rsquo;s appointment, over the next five years it hopes that he will advance academic projects by engaging with issues that confront society. Soyinka will be mentoring and lecturing at the university&rsquo;s "distinguished lectures" where the public is invited to talk about literature, governance and development, among a host of other themes.Among his artistic recognitions, Soyinka has received the AGIP "Enrico Mattei" Award for the humanities; the Leopold Sedar Senghor Award for the arts; the John Whiting Award for drama; the Benson Medal from the Royal Society for Literature; the Premio Grinzane Cavour, Premio Litterario Internazionalle Mondello (Italy); and the Unesco Medal for the Arts; as well as Commander of the French L&eacute;gion d&rsquo;Honneur.Currently he is Life Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge; Emeritus Fellow of the Black Mountain Institute, University of Nevada; Overseas Fellow of Hutchins Institute, Harvard University; and Prof Emeritus, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria; and founder and chairman of the Wole Soyinka Foundation, Nigeria.Educated in Ibadan, Nigeria, and Leeds, England, where he obtained honours in English, Soyinka has held fellowship and professorial positions in the dramatic arts and comparative literature at the universities of Ibadan, Lagos and Ife (Nigeria), Legon (Ghana), Sheffield and Cambridge (England), and Yale, Cornell, Harvard, Emory, Nevada, and Loyola Marymount (US). He continues lecturing in other American, European, African and Chinese universities.He has a stellar record in teaching, publications, and public intellectual discourse, says Prof Alex Broadbent, executive dean, faculty of humanities at UJ. "He has been and continues to be associated with some of the best Universities in the world. UJ&rsquo;s drive to decolonisation, as well as the Africanisation of knowledge, has led to substantial dialogues at the institution. These conversations provide the university the opportunity to ask searching questions about our African identity and our role in nurturing the &lsquo;New Africa&rsquo;, and the future of our university. Soyinka, as a high profile academic and social influencer, whose work, sentiments, and political positionality is taken very seriously in Africa, and across the world, will bring a new dimension to this discourse."In 2016, Soyinka took a politically principled stance to leave the US where he has pursued an academic career for the past four decades &mdash; an ironic reverse-journey of his politically informed departure from Nigeria in the 1970s. "The return of Soyinka to Africa and associated renegotiation of his American university appointments offers UJ the opportunity to work more avidly and closely with the high-profile scholar," says Broadbent.Soyinka would also bring the work of his foundation to the institution for partnership anchoring. "Beyond the funds associated with the acclaimed Wole Soyinka Award for literature, there is the added value of the foundation meetings that will attract high-profile participants and enhance literature work at UJ worldwide. This will result in the further realisation of the internationalisation of the curriculum, and add to UJ&rsquo;s international partnerships and mobility. The research and publications envisaged to flow from the foundation work will be important too for UJ&rsquo;s research profile," says Broadbent."His presence at UJ is bound to attract other respected scholars in his and associated areas of work, thus enhancing UJ&rsquo;s visibility and ability to attract even more excellent students and scholars of repute, both locally and internationally."

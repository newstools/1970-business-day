The JSE pushed higher on Tuesday as some technology shares rebounded after a sharp drop recently, suggesting the moves lower may have been a blip, rather than a trend.The all share index was up 0.53% to 51,839.40 points at lunchtime, as Naspers recovered from a plunge of nearly 6% in its share price, in line with Hong Kong-listed Tencent, in which the media group has a 34% interest.The recovery in Naspers s share price, along with a rally in Richemont, boosted industrials.Adding to the positive tone were mining stocks, particularly platinum miners and diversified miners, which drew support from relatively higher commodity prices.GT Private Broking s head of trading, Nilan Morar, attributed the rally in the platinum shares in particular to a steady rise in the price of palladium, which has partly mitigated the low platinum price.Palladium has risen 31% to $905.91 an ounce so far in 2017, compared with platinum that dropped 4% over the same period.Leading European share markets were higher at midday, following their counterparts in Asia, where China s Shanghai Composite index settled 0.44% higher.US stock futures were relatively flat as the US Federal Reserve held a two-day policy meeting. The world s most influential central bank was expected to raise the repurchase rate at least 25 basis points on Wednesday.Among some individual stocks, Naspers regained 1.16% to R2,554.39, with Richemont gaining 1.98% to R105.49.Among platinum stocks, Impala Platinum was up 3.59% to R37.77, with Northam Platinum gaining 4.24% to R46.74. But AngloGold Ashanti shed 2.92% to R147.06 and Gold Fields dropped 3.15% to R45.56, owing to lower gold price.

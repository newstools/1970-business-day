The JSE&rsquo;s banks were once again the biggest casualties of the rand&rsquo;s nearly 3% U-turn after President Jacob Zuma ordered Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to return to SA from an investor roadshow in the UK.The banking index fell 2.5% to 7,731 points, tracking the rand which swung from R12.31/$ to R12.67/$.FirstRand suffered most with a 3.3% drop to R50.74, followed by Barclays Group Africa, which fell 2.9% to R153.93.Standard Bank lost 2.7% to R154.76, Nedbank 2.6% to R255.96, and FirstRand parent RMH 2.5% to R63.51.On December 10 2015, Zuma sent the JSE s banking index tumbling 13.5% when he shocked the market by replacing Nhlanhla Nene with Des van Rooyen as finance minister. The banking index then rebounded 8.5% on December 14 when Van Rooyen was replaced with Gordhan."I believe today could be a test of the water to undertake a reshuffle," Nomura International analyst Peter Attard Montalto said in an e-mail."The Presidency has seen such a strong rand and is wondering how much of a political shock it can take they do watch these things closely. So far the market reaction has been very muted. Suggesting they could indeed go ahead with a reshuffle."

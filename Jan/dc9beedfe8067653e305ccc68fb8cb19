Bengaluru Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk says his latest company, Neuralink Corporation, is working to link the human brain with a machine interface by creating micron-sized devices.Neuralink is aiming to bring a product to the market that helps with certain severe brain injuries due to stroke, cancer lesions, etc, in about four years, Musk said in an interview with website Wait But Why."If I were to communicate a concept to you, you would essentially engage in consensual telepathy," Musk said in the interview published on Thursday.Artificial intelligence and machine-learning will create computers so sophisticated and god-like that humans will need to implant "neural laces" in their brains to keep up, Musk said in a tech conference last year."There are a bunch of concepts in your head that your brain then has to try to compress into this incredibly low-data rate called speech or typing," Musk said in the latest interview. "If you have two brain interfaces, you could actually do an uncompressed direct conceptual communication with another person."The technology could take about eight to 10 years to become usable by people with no disability, which would depend heavily on regulatory approval timing and how well the devices work on people with disabilities, Musk was quoted as saying.In March, the Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had launched a company through which computers could merge with human brains. Neuralink was registered in California as a "medical research" company last July, and Musk plans on funding the company mostly by himself.Reuters

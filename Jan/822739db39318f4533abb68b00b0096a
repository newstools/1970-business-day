Militants drove a van at high speed into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing Saturday night revellers on the street and in nearby bars, killing at least seven&nbsp;people and wounding more than 30.Armed police rushed to the scene and shot dead the three male attackers in the Borough Market area near the bridge as authorities urged Londoners on Twitter to "run, hide, tell" if they were caught up in the violence.The attacks come days ahead of a June 8 election and less than two weeks after a suicide bomber killed 22 people at a pop concert by US singer Ariana Grande in Manchester in northern England. There was no immediate claim of responsibility."Sadly, six people have died in addition to the three attackers shot by police," Mark Rowley, Britain's top anti-terrorism officer, said. The three attackers had been wearing what looked like explosive vests that were later found to have been hoaxes.The BBC showed a photograph of two possible attackers shot by police, one of whom had canisters strapped to his body. Hours after the attack the area, just downstream from London's government quarter, remained sealed off and patrolled by armed police and counter-terrorism officers.The London ambulance service said more than 30 people had been taken to hospitals across the city.

He saw at least six people on the ground after the van veered on and off the pavement."It was horrendous," he said.A taxi driver told the BBC that three men got out of the van with long knives and "went randomly along Borough High Street stabbing people."Witnesses described people running into a bar to seek shelter."People started running and screaming, and the van crashes into the railing behind. We went toward Borough Market and everyone went inside (the bar). Everyone in the bar started pushing people from the exits," one witness who gave his name as Brian, 32, told Reuters.Another witness, who declined to be named, his white top covered in blood, described a scene of panic in the bar."They hit the emergency alarm. There was a line of people going down to the emergency exit. And then people started screaming coming back up," the 31-year-old said."Around the corner there was a guy with a stab wound on his neck ... There was a doctor in the pub and she helped him. They put pressure on the stab wound."BBC radio said witnesses saw people throwing tables and chairs at the attackers to protect themselves.Islamic state callThe BBC showed dozens of people, evidently caught up in the attack, being escorted to safety through a police cordon with their hands on their heads.Islamic State, losing territory in Syria and Iraq to an advance backed by a US-led coalition, sent out a call on instant messaging service Telegram early on Saturday urging its followers to launch attacks with trucks, knives and guns against "Crusaders" during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Similar attacks, in Berlin, Nice, Brussels and Paris, have been carried out by militants over the past two years.Prime Minister Theresa May was due to chair a meeting of the Cobra security committee later on Sunday.US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to offer U.S. help to Britain.

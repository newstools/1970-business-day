The application lodged by the South African Social Security Agency&rsquo;s (Sassa) CEO Thokozani Magwaza regarding the payment of social grants was not authorised by the acting CEO or the social development minister, leading to it being withdrawn, the agency said in new papers filed with the Constitutional Court on Thursday.Magwaza &mdash; who is on sick leave &mdash; filed an urgent application earlier this week asking the court to allow Sassa to enter into another year-long contract with Cash Payment Services (CPS) so it could continue to pay more than 17-million social grants come April 1. However, less than 24 hours afterwards, the application was withdrawn.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini and acting Sassa CEO Thamo Mzobe have not lodged a new application with the court but have sent a "follow-up report". In the report, Dlamini and Mzobe said they were not consulted before Magwaza lodged the application."Once aware of the decision, the minister instructed Sassa to withdraw the application," they said in the report lodged with the court, adding that Sassa was still investigating the circumstances behind the filing of the first application. According to their report, Magwaza&rsquo;s affidavit contained errors and the follow-up report reflects Sassa&rsquo;s position.Earlier this week, Sassa officials admitted in Parliament that it had no plan to distribute social grants to more 11-million beneficiaries other than to extend the Net1 subsidiary&rsquo;s CPS contract.In 2014, the court found that Sassa&rsquo;s contract with CPS was irregular. Part of the follow-up report was Sassa&rsquo;s "intended course of action" in which it said its conduct to date had been based on its intention to assume the function of paying and administering social grants itself."Sassa now accepts that to pursue this intention in the short or medium term will cause undue delay in putting the payment of social grants on a lawful footing," it said. "Instead, it would run a competitive bidding process to have a new contractor or contracts in place."Sassa and the minister would continue to take steps to implement its policy objectives. According to the report, the minister appreciated that it may take longer, possibly five years, to implement Sassa&rsquo;s policy objective. "The minister has mandated a negotiating team to consult on negotiations with CPS to reach an arrangement whereby CPS will continue to pay social grants after March 31 2017," they said in the report.A transitional arrangement would be negotiated whereby the scope and duration would be limited, as far as reasonably possible, be within budget and be on reasonable terms. The intention is that new service providers will be appointed on a competitive basis.Sassa said CPS indicated its willingness to engage with the agency and assist in ensuring grant payments continued. Formal negotiations started on Wednesday.Dlamini and Sassa would engage "co-operatively" with National Treasury and other stakeholders regarding the appropriate solutions to the challenges being faced.

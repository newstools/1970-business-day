Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini arrived at the Cape Sun on Monday afternoon, as a crowd dressed in ANC colours welcomed her with song."Viva ANC Women&rsquo;s president&sbquo; viva!" they screamed.The minister has come under fire in recent days for her handling of the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) payment crisis.Among the crowd were people in wheelchairs and pastors in church garb.While many are reluctant to say who summoned them to the four-star hotel&sbquo; it is understood that Dlamini was due to reassure them that they would receive payment of their state grants.Her department has been mired in controversy over the possibility that 17-million beneficiaries might not get paid.The contract between the department and Cash Paymaster Services was declared illegal by the Constitutional Court. It will lapse on March 31.However, a new deal with Cash Paymaster Services and the department was on the table.TMG Digital

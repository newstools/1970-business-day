Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says the government remains confident that a solution to the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) crisis will be found before the end of March.Responding to questions in the National Assembly on Thursday, Ramaphosa said the matter was being addressed "at the highest level"."A solution should be found to address the challenge we have at hand &hellip; the Constitutional Court has entered the scene and the matter is being dealt with at the highest level. It will be resolved, it must be resolved &hellip; there is no other way," said Ramaphosa.However, he dodged questions from DA leader Mmusi Maimane and the UDM&rsquo;s Bantu Holomisa about whether Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini should be fired for her mishandling of the crisis."Members of the executive are evaluated by the President on an ongoing basis &hellip; it is up to the President &hellip; he is the only who can do so [evaluate her fitness to hold office]," said Ramaphosa.Sassa has not yet developed a system to pay the grants to 17-million beneficiaries, and has been negotiating with Cash Paymaster Service (CPS) &mdash; its current service provider &mdash; to continue distributing the grants.While Sassa&rsquo;s contract with CPS was declared invalid and unlawful by the Constitutional Court, the agency has said it will have to renew the CPS deal because there is no viable alternative to pay grants, from April 1. The current contract expires on March 31.On Wednesday, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng instructed Sassa to inform the Constitutional Court whether it had entered into a new contract with CPS, among other things. He gave Sassa until Monday to provide the court with full details of any agreement.Dlamini was unable to provide answers on a new deal with CPS when she appeared before Parliament s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) earlier this week, and when she addressed the media last week.During her appearance before Scopa, Dlamini said no new contract had been signed with CPS. She said a technical negotiating team would submit its report by Thursday.Sassa will need to get the Treasury s approval for deviating from the Public Finance Management Act, because the contract has not been put out to tender.However, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has said an extended or new contract with CPS would be unlawful and uncompetitive. Such a contract would contravene the requirements of section 217 of the Constitution, and would constitute a deviation from prescribed procurement procedures. The minister stated that he would not sanction such deviation unless the Constitutional Court agreed to this request.On Thursday, Ramaphosa said that given the timeframes, he was confident that the court would deal with the issue as a matter of urgency." I am certain the court will pull out all stops to deal with this matter with the level of urgency required. It is a matter of enormous proportions, but the matter is being dealt with and I am absolutely certain a solution will be found."
